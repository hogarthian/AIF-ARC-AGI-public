    "uncertainty": "The test case instructions for 'Region 1' specified a coordinate range of 'A1:J12'. However, based on the input grid and the general instructions, the actual 4-connected region of the fillable color (yellow) extends over the entire 'A1:J20' area. Treating 'A1:J12' as a distinct region would make it convex, which according to the general rules would require a 'flood fill', contradicting the specific instruction to use 'alternating concentric frames'. By assuming the instruction's coordinates were an imprecise description of the full 'A1:J20' region, the region becomes 'non-convex', which correctly aligns with the specified 'alternating concentric frames' filling method. I proceeded with this assumption, applying the pattern fill to the entire 'A1:J20' area.",

First, for Region 3 (V1:AD7 approx), the instruction mentioned a seed 'Red(2) at V22', but the input grid has no such seed in or near that region; the region is devoid of seeds. I proceeded assuming it has no seeds and should remain unchanged, per the general rules. Second, for Region 2 (M1:T7 approx), the instruction listed only 'Magenta(6) at M1' as the seed, but the grid shows that Yellow(4) at N2 and Gray(5) at O3 are also adjacent to this same region. I assumed all three seeds should be used to create the fill pattern, as this is more consistent with the general rules for regions with multiple seeds.",
