However, inspection of the input grid reveals three seeds in this region: Magenta(6) at M1, Yellow(4) at N2, and Gray(5) at O3. The general instructions for multiple seeds dictate using an ordered list of all seeds, which would be [6, 4, 5]. I chose to follow the general rule, as it seemed more consistent with the overall logic described in the hypothesis. Additionally, step 3c located a seed for Region 3 at V22, which is outside the region; I assumed this was a typo for V2, which is the only seed inside that region.",
