However, based on the input grid and the general instructions, the actual 4-connected region of the fillable color (yellow) extends over the entire 'A1:J20' area. Treating 'A1:J12' as a distinct region would make it convex, which according to the general rules would require a 'flood fill', contradicting the specific instruction to use 'alternating concentric frames'. By assuming the instruction's coordinates were an imprecise description of the full 'A1:J20' region, the region becomes 'non-convex', which correctly aligns with the specified 'alternating concentric frames' filling method. I proceeded with this assumption, applying the pattern fill to the entire 'A1:J20' area.",

First, for Region 3 (V1:AD7 approx), the instruction mentioned a seed 'Red(2) at V22', but the input grid has no such seed in or near that region; the region is devoid of seeds. I proceeded assuming it has no seeds and should remain unchanged, per the general rules. Second, for Region 2 (M1:T7 approx), the instruction listed only 'Magenta(6) at M1' as the seed, but the grid shows that Yellow(4) at N2 and Gray(5) at O3 are also adjacent to this same region. I assumed all three seeds should be used to create the fill pattern, as this is more consistent with the general rules for regions with multiple seeds.",

However, inspection of the input grid reveals three seeds in this region: Magenta(6) at M1, Yellow(4) at N2, and Gray(5) at O3. The general instructions for multiple seeds dictate using an ordered list of all seeds, which would be [6, 4, 5]. I chose to follow the general rule, as it seemed more consistent with the overall logic described in the hypothesis. Additionally, step 3c located a seed for Region 3 at V22, which is outside the region; I assumed this was a typo for V2, which is the only seed inside that region.",
