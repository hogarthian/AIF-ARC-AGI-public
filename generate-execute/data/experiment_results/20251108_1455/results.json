        "uncertainty": "The specific instructions for the test case define four rectangular regions (TL, TR, BL, BR). However, the actual non-divider cells in the input grid do not perfectly align with these simple rectangles due to a complex 'divider' shape. For example, some non-divider cells like R10, S10, T10 fall outside any of the defined rectangular regions. Also, the BR region contains part of the divider line within its specified rectangle. I have assumed that the instructions intend for the transformation to apply *only* to the non-divider cells *within* the specified rectangular bounding boxes. Any non-divider cells outside these boxes are assumed to remain unchanged. For regions containing divider cells (like BR), I assumed those divider cells are also unchanged, and the fill operation applies only to the other cells in the specified box.",

However, based on the working hypothesis's definition of a region as a 4-connected component of non-divider cells, the test input's divider shape actually creates only three regions, with TL and BL forming a single connected component. Despite this discrepancy in the description, the specified filling actions (filling TL with its own pattern and BL by inheriting that same pattern) lead to the same unambiguous final state as treating TL and BL as a single large region. I proceeded by implementing the outcome described by the instructions.",

This contradicts the general instruction that a region is a 'maximal 4-connected component of non-divider cells', as the cells in columns A-H would form a single large 4-connected region. I followed the specific test case instructions, assuming they override the general rule. Additionally, the region definitions provided (TL, TR, BL, BR) do not cover all non-divider cells, specifically omitting R10:T10. I treated these cells as a separate, unseeded region. According to the general instructions, an unseeded region not adjacent to the primary region should be filled with its background color. Since these cells were already the background color (blue), I left them unchanged.",

However, the input grid data shows the horizontal part of the divider only extends to the right of the vertical line, creating a 'T' shape on its side and only three distinct regions. I proceeded by following the more fundamental general instructions to define regions based on the actual divider shape in the data (3 regions). This combines the described 'TL' and 'BL' regions into a single 'Left' primary region. Fortunately, the final outcome is consistent with the filling rules described for the individual 'TL' and 'BL' regions, as both were to be filled with the same color pattern, so the result is the same.",

This contradicts the general hypothesis that a region is a single 4-connected component. To resolve this, I assumed the instruction's bounding box defines the area of operation for the fill. For spiral fills in such cases (like R5), the algorithm was applied to the entire bounding box, but divider cells within it were preserved (not overwritten), effectively creating a synchronized spiral pattern in the disjoint sub-regions.",
