        "uncertainty": "The instructions were clear enough to solve the puzzle, but there were two minor points of ambiguity. First, the 'wall' in the test case was described as a 'T' shape, but it was actually a vertical line with two horizontal lines extending from it; this was a minor inaccuracy that was easily resolved by inspecting the grid data. Second, the coordinate ranges given for the regions (e.g., 'J11:T20') were simplified and did not account for the exact complex boundaries created by the wall. I had to determine the precise region boundaries by applying the general rule of finding 4-connected components of non-wall cells. In the end, the conclusions in the step-by-step instructions were correct, so these ambiguities did not prevent a successful transformation.",

However, the specific instructions for the test case explicitly state that 'Four regions are identified' and provide instructions only for those four, omitting any mention of the cells at A7:F7. Based on the directive to 'Apply the test case instructions precisely', I assumed this omission was intentional and that the cells in the unmentioned region A7:F7 should remain unchanged from the input.",

        "uncertainty": "The provided test case instructions contained several points that contradicted the input grid data and the general hypothesis. I proceeded by following the instructions as precisely as possible, making the following assumptions: 1. The region boundaries specified in the instructions (e.g., 'A10:G15', 'A16:H23') were treated as correct, even though they do not always align with the 'wall' structure found in the input grid. This implies the existence of implicit, invisible boundaries. 2. The seed lists provided in the instructions (e.g., '[2]' for R(I1:AD8)) were used, even when a scan of the input grid revealed a different set of seeds (e.g., '[4,3,2]'). 3. The instruction to fill region R(R10:AD15) with seed '[2]' was followed literally, despite the region being monochromatic in the input and the seed's origin not fitting the established 'borrowing' rule. 4. The instruction for certain regions to 'remain unchanged' was interpreted as 'fill with the background color (8)', based on the pattern in the training examples. This was necessary because the specified regions actually contained seeds in the input grid, and leaving them would violate the overall spiral-fill aesthetic.",

The instructions state there are four regions, but based on the '4-connected component of non-wall cells' rule from the general instructions, the top-left and bottom-left areas form a single region, resulting in only three regions total.\n2. The instructions for Region 4 state its border with the wall is 'L-shaped'. However, its border with the actual red (2) wall pixels is a single straight vertical line.\nTo resolve these contradictions, I assumed that the regions are defined as the four quadrants created by the idealized dividing axes of the wall (column I and row 10), and that the border analysis for Region 4 also refers to these idealized axes, not the literal red pixels.

The instructions describe a 'cross' shaped wall and four resulting regions. However, the wall in the input grid is a T-shape, which only creates three 4-connected regions of the background color. I resolved this by assuming that the regions are defined not by strict connectivity but by a conceptual division of the grid into four quadrants along the main axes of the wall (column K and row 13). This interpretation allowed me to apply the specific instructions for all four described regions and produced a result consistent with the provided logic.",

However, based on the wall definition (the magenta 'L' shape) and the general rule that regions are 4-connected components of non-wall cells, the bottom-left region is actually the larger area A7:F10. I assumed the coordinate range in the specific instruction was a minor error and followed the more general rule, defining Region 3 as the full 4-connected area A7:F10. This resulted in filling a 6x4 area instead of the 6x3 area implied by the specific instruction's coordinates.",

Specifically: 1) The seed lists for the first two regions (`R(A1:K25)` and `R(M1:T7)`) did not match the seeds found within those regions according to the general rules. 2) The region labels (e.g., `R(M9:Q14)`) did not match the geometric location of the actual regions partitioned by the wall. 3) The seed list for the central 'hole' region was `[4,1]`, but the region's geometry (2 cells wide) only allows for a single-color fill under the 'outer layer' spiral algorithm; it cannot accommodate a two-color spiral. To resolve these conflicts, I prioritized the general instructions over the specific, seemingly flawed test case instructions. I assumed that magenta (color 6) is not a seed color, as it was consistently omitted from all provided seed lists. I also deduced that any region only 1 or 2 cells thick would be filled with a single color (the first in its seed list) because it constitutes a single 'outer layer'.",
