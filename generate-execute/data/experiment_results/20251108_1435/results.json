The instruction says to flood-fill this entire region with a single color based on a seed in one of its sub-regions. I interpreted this to mean that the fill rule applies to the entire bounding box described, and the internal separator is ignored for determining the fill rule for the whole area, but is still drawn in the final output. This assumption was necessary to resolve the ambiguity of how to handle the seedless sub-region (R11:T15) that was part of the larger, seeded conceptual region (J11:T15).",

This was ambiguous because the general instructions state that regions are composed of non-separator colors. The separator itself is a solid red (color 2) line/cross shape. I assumed this instruction was intended for hypothetical non-separator cells embedded within the separator structure, and since none existed in this test case, the instruction had no effect. Consequently, I left the separator cells (color 2) unchanged in the output, which seemed the most logical interpretation consistent with the overall pattern.",

Instructions d and e state that the cells R9 (row 8, col 17) and T10 (row 9, col 19) are in separate, single-seed regions. However, a 4-connectivity analysis of the input grid shows they belong to the same large 'H-shaped' region, which contains two seeds in total: 4 and 1. The general rules state that regions are 'maximal 4-connected' and that regions with two or more seeds should be filled with a spiral. To resolve this conflict, I chose to follow the general rules, as applying the specific instructions literally was impossible (e.g., flood-filling the same region with two different colors). I identified the single large H-shaped region, determined its seed list to be [4, 1] based on row-major scan order, and applied the spiral fill rule for multi-seed regions. All other regions were processed as per the instructions, which were consistent for those areas.",

Instruction 2.f stated 'Region containing I25' but listed seeds at coordinates (W25, X26) which are in a different region.

However, it appears to conflict with the general instructions. The area `J11:T15` is divided by a vertical separator line (color 2 at column Q) into two distinct 4-connected regions. One region (`J11:P15`) contains the seed (color 3), and the other (`R11:T15`) does not. According to the general instructions (rule 4c), the seedless region `R11:T15` should have inherited the seed list `[8, 4]` from another region and been filled with a spiral, not flood-filled with green. I proceeded by assuming the specific test case instruction overrode the general rule for this particular case, implying that the entire area between the horizontal separators was treated as a single conceptual unit for filling.",

The instructions described the separator as a 'red '+' shape' which would partition the grid into four regions. However, the grid data clearly shows a backwards 'L' or 'gamma' shape, which partitions the grid into only three regions. 2. Following from the first point, the instructions described a fourth region ('The region on the separator line at row 13') and provided filling instructions for it. Based on the general rule of finding 'maximal 4-connected regions', this fourth region does not exist. I assumed this part of the instructions was an error and ignored it. 3. The spreadsheet coordinates given for the seed colors were slightly inaccurate (e.g., 'L2' for a seed at L1). I followed the specified colors ([8, 1]) rather than the exact coordinates, as the colors were present in the correct regions.",

I followed the explicit instruction and used [4, 5].\n2. The locations for seeds in the top-right and middle 'H' regions were specified with incorrect coordinates (e.g., pointing to a background or separator cell instead of the actual seed cell). I identified the correct seed cell nearby and proceeded assuming the region and seed color were correct.\n3. The instructions identified two separate single-seed regions inside the middle 'H' shape (one with seed 4, one with seed 1) and prescribed flood-filling for each. However, these two seeds are located within the same 4-connected region. This is a direct contradiction. To resolve this, I assumed the intention was to partition this single region based on the proximity to each seed (a Voronoi partition) and fill each partition with its corresponding seed color. Cells equidistant were assigned the color of the first seed mentioned (4).",
