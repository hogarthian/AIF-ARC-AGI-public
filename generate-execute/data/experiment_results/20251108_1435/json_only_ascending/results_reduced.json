    "uncertainty": "The specific instruction for Test T0, item 4c, states: 'Region J11:T15 (1 seed): ... Flood-fill with seed color 3.' This was followed precisely. However, it appears to conflict with the general instructions. The area `J11:T15` is divided by a vertical separator line (color 2 at column Q) into two distinct 4-connected regions. One region (`J11:P15`) contains the seed (color 3), and the other (`R11:T15`) does not. According to the general instructions (rule 4c), the seedless region `R11:T15` should have inherited the seed list `[8, 4]` from another region and been filled with a spiral, not flood-filled with green. I proceeded by assuming the specific test case instruction overrode the general rule for this particular case, implying that the entire area between the horizontal separators was treated as a single conceptual unit for filling.",

    "uncertainty": "The test case instructions contained several inconsistencies with the provided input grid and the general rules, requiring assumptions to proceed. 1. The instructions described the separator as a 'red '+' shape' which would partition the grid into four regions. However, the grid data clearly shows a backwards 'L' or 'gamma' shape, which partitions the grid into only three regions. 2. Following from the first point, the instructions described a fourth region ('The region on the separator line at row 13') and provided filling instructions for it. Based on the general rule of finding 'maximal 4-connected regions', this fourth region does not exist. I assumed this part of the instructions was an error and ignored it. 3. The spreadsheet coordinates given for the seed colors were slightly inaccurate (e.g., 'L2' for a seed at L1). I followed the specified colors ([8, 1]) rather than the exact coordinates, as the colors were present in the correct regions.",

The seed list for the top-middle region was given as [4, 5], but a scan of the region reveals an earlier seed (color 6 at M1), which would result in a seed list of [6, 4, 5]. I followed the explicit instruction and used [4, 5].\n2. The locations for seeds in the top-right and middle 'H' regions were specified with incorrect coordinates (e.g., pointing to a background or separator cell instead of the actual seed cell). I identified the correct seed cell nearby and proceeded assuming the region and seed color were correct.\n3. The instructions identified two separate single-seed regions inside the middle 'H' shape (one with seed 4, one with seed 1) and prescribed flood-filling for each. However, these two seeds are located within the same 4-connected region. This is a direct contradiction. To resolve this, I assumed the intention was to partition this single region based on the proximity to each seed (a Voronoi partition) and fill each partition with its corresponding seed color. Cells equidistant were assigned the color of the first seed mentioned (4).",
