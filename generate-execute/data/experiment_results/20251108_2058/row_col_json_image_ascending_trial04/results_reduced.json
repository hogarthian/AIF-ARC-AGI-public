    "uncertainty": "The specific instructions for Test T0 divided the grid into four regions, including a 'Top-Left' and 'Bottom-Left' region. However, based on the general instruction that regions are 'maximal 4-connected components of background-colored cells', the entire left side of the grid (columns A-J) constitutes a single, larger region. The specific instructions describe a process where the Bottom-Left region inherits from the Top-Left, while the more fundamental rule implies the entire single Left region is filled based on its own seed. Both interpretations fortuitously lead to the same final grid, so I proceeded with that result. The region descriptions in the specific test case instructions may have been slightly simplified for clarity.",

However, the general instructions and hypothesis state that regions are 'maximal 4-connected components of background-colored cells'. Based on the input grid, the actual 4-connected component of background cells in that area is larger, spanning coordinates A7:F10. I followed the general rule, assuming the specific coordinate range in the test instruction was a minor typo, and calculated the spiral fill for the A7:F10 region.",

I followed the explicit instruction and used only [4, 5]. There is a conceptual contradiction in the general instructions where a 'region' is defined as being composed of background cells but is also described as containing non-background 'seed' cells; I assumed that seeds are non-background, non-divider cells that are enclosed by or adjacent to a connected component of background cells. Finally, when a no-seed region was adjacent to multiple source regions in the highest-priority direction (e.g., 'Above'), I assumed that a region with its own primary seeds takes precedence as a source over a region that merely inherited its pattern.",

    "uncertainty": "The Test Case Instructions presented several ambiguities and contradictions with the General Instructions, requiring significant assumptions to resolve. 1) For the Top-Left region, the specified seed list `[3, 4]` contradicts the `row-major` scan order defined in the General Instructions, which would yield `[4, 3]`. I followed the specific test instruction's list. 2) The instructions for the bottom half of the grid define logical regions and their corresponding seed lists in a way that conflicts with the primary partitioning rule (regions as 4-connected components of background). It appears that physically separate regions were logically grouped. To proceed, I assumed that all physical sub-regions belonging to a single logical group should be filled with spirals using the same shared seed list, but with each spiral's distance field calculated independently based on its own local boundaries.",
