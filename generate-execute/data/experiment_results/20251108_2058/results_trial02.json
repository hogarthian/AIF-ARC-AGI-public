I interpreted 'spiral' as a series of concentric layers, where a cell's layer is determined by its Chebyshev distance (maximum coordinate difference) to the nearest cell outside the region. This method is consistent with the rectangular spiral patterns seen in other examples and provides a logical way to generalize the pattern to complex shapes.",

The instructions for the bottom-left region started at row 14, leaving row 13 (A13:J13) undefined.

I followed the explicit region definitions from the test instructions. Second, the area calculations for some regions (e.g., Region 6: 168 cells, Region 7: 60 cells) were inconsistent with the provided coordinate ranges. I followed the coordinate ranges and ignored the inconsistent area numbers. Third, the instructions for Region 3 and 5 mentioned seeds outside the region's boundaries; I followed the final conclusion given in the instructions for which seeds to use or to consider the region as seedless.",

Similarly, Region 2 was described as having an area of 170, while my count was 164.

I prioritized the 4-connected component rule from the hypothesis to define the true regions.\n2. The instructions omitted several regions that contained no 'seed' colors.
