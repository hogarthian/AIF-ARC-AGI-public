Similarly, Region 2 was described as having an area of 170, while my count was 164. However, the logical conclusions drawn from these areas (e.g., 'area <= 40 -> apply flood fill') were still correct with my calculated values, so I proceeded by following the specified transformation type (flood fill or spiral) for each region.",

Region boundaries and areas listed in the instructions were often incorrect (e.g., 'A10:G14' for a region that is actually 'A10:G30' based on 4-connectivity). I prioritized the 4-connected component rule from the hypothesis to define the true regions.\n2. The instructions omitted several regions that contained no 'seed' colors. I identified these regions and left them unchanged (filled with the background color) as per the general rules.\n3. For one region ('Region 4', corresponding to my identified region at I10:P15), the instruction to 'flood fill' contradicted the general rule which would require a spiral fill (since its area of 48 is > 40).
