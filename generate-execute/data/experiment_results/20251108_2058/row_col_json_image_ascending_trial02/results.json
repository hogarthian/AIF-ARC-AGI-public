    "uncertainty": "The instructions mention filling regions with a 'spiral pattern'. For the non-rectangular region, this term is ambiguous. I interpreted 'spiral' as a series of concentric layers, where a cell's layer is determined by its Chebyshev distance (maximum coordinate difference) to the nearest cell outside the region. This method is consistent with the rectangular spiral patterns seen in other examples and provides a logical way to generalize the pattern to complex shapes.",

In the input grid, these two quadrants are connected by background-colored cells, forming a single contiguous region. I followed the instructions by treating them as two separate regions, assuming this was the intended logical structure despite the visual input. The instructions for the bottom-left region started at row 14, leaving row 13 (A13:J13) undefined. I included these cells in the bottom-left region; as this region was specified to be left unchanged, this choice did not alter the final output.",

First, the region definitions provided (e.g., `I1:AD8` and `I16:AD23`) contradicted the visible separator lines in the input grid (e.g., the blue line in column V), which according to the general rules should have split these regions. I followed the explicit region definitions from the test instructions. Second, the area calculations for some regions (e.g., Region 6: 168 cells, Region 7: 60 cells) were inconsistent with the provided coordinate ranges. I followed the coordinate ranges and ignored the inconsistent area numbers. Third, the instructions for Region 3 and 5 mentioned seeds outside the region's boundaries; I followed the final conclusion given in the instructions for which seeds to use or to consider the region as seedless.",
