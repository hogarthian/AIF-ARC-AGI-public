I assumed the specific instruction for the test case takes precedence, meaning the fill operation for the rectangular region overwrites the divider cells within it. This resolved the ambiguity.",

However, an examination of the input grid shows that only column H is a complete vertical line of the divider color (1). Columns I, Q, and V contain other colors and are not simple vertical dividers. I proceeded by assuming the panel boundaries and regions defined in the step-by-step instructions (e.g., Panel 1 at A1:G30) were the intended logical partitions, even though they don't perfectly align with a strict definition of dividers based on the grid data. Additionally, some seed coordinates in the instructions for Panel 2 appeared to be off by one column (e.g., 'J17(4)' which is at I17, 'K18(9)' which is at J18, 'I8(2)' which was corrected to 'J8(2)' but is actually at I8). I followed the color sequences provided, which seem to be derived from the actual seed locations, assuming the coordinates in the instructions were typos.",
