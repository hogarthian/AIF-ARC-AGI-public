EXPERIMENT: Output Diversity Baseline - Multiple Sampling

Purpose:
This experiment measures output diversity when sampling multiple times with the same parameters
(modality, order, temperature) without changing the training example order. This serves as a
baseline to compare against order augmentation experiments.

Configuration:
- Modality: row_col_json_image
- Order: ascending (fixed)
- Temperature: 0.7
- Number of trials: 4
- Model: gemini/gemini-2.5-pro

Hypothesis:
Our paper claims that varying training example orders can produce more diverse results than
simple multiple sampling. This experiment provides the baseline for that comparison.

Expected Analysis:
Compare the diversity of outputs across these 4 trials with the diversity
observed when using different training example orders (ascending vs descending) in the
cross-order experiment.
