This serves as a\nbaseline to compare against order augmentation experiments.\n\nConfiguration:\n- Modality: row_col_json_image\n- Order: ascending (fixed)\n- Temperature: 0.7\n- Number of trials: 4\n- Model: gemini/gemini-2.5-pro\n\nHypothesis:\nOur paper claims that varying training example orders can produce more diverse results than\nsimple multiple sampling. This experiment provides the baseline for that comparison.\n\nExpected Analysis:\nCompare the diversity of outputs across these 4 trials with the diversity\nobserved when using different training example orders (ascending vs descending) in the\ncross-order experiment.\n",

For instance, in example E0, the instructions imply the bottom-left inherited region should be a solid color, but the output shows a complex pattern. Similarly, the spiral pattern in the top-left region of E0 does not strictly follow the provided Chebyshev distance formula. However, the task is to 'Apply the test case instructions precisely'. Therefore, I have followed the instructions for test case T0 literally, using the specified Chebyshev method for generating spirals. The instructions for T0 also did not specify what to do with the background-colored cells in the region A13:J13 (row 12, columns 0-9). Based on the quadrant logic derived from the examples, this area is not part of the four main regions. As it was not mentioned, I assumed it should remain unchanged from the input.",

I followed the more specific test instructions. This created an ambiguity for the background cells at A7:F7, which are not mentioned in any of the four regions to be processed.
