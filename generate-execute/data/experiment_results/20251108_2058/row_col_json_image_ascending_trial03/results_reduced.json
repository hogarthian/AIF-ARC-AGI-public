I followed the corrected rule, assuming it supersedes the first one. This could be a point of confusion. The generalization of a 'spiral fill' to a non-rectangular shape was interpreted as a layered fill based on distance from the shape's boundary, which seemed the most logical approach but was not explicitly defined in the general instructions.",

This assumption worked out because the fill logic correctly ignores non-background (i.e., divider) cells, so only the background parts of that row were affected as intended.",

I proceeded with this assumption, as it was explicitly stated in the test instructions for T0, resolving the conflict with a more literal interpretation of the general instructions.",
