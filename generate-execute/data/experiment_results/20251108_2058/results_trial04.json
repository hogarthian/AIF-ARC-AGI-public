        "uncertainty": "The working hypothesis and general instructions for generating spiral patterns (using Chebyshev distance) and filling inherited regions do not perfectly match the provided training example outputs. For instance, in example E0, the instructions imply the bottom-left inherited region should be a solid color, but the output shows a complex pattern. Similarly, the spiral pattern in the top-left region of E0 does not strictly follow the provided Chebyshev distance formula. However, the task is to 'Apply the test case instructions precisely'. Therefore, I have followed the instructions for test case T0 literally, using the specified Chebyshev method for generating spirals. The instructions for T0 also did not specify what to do with the background-colored cells in the region A13:J13 (row 12, columns 0-9). Based on the quadrant logic derived from the examples, this area is not part of the four main regions. As it was not mentioned, I assumed it should remain unchanged from the input.",

For the test case, this would result in three regions, as the background cells at A7:F7 connect the top-left and bottom-left areas. However, the specific 'Test Case Instructions' partition the grid into four distinct regions (e.g., 'Top-Left (A1:F6)' and 'Bottom-Left (A8:F10)' are treated as separate). I followed the more specific test instructions. This created an ambiguity for the background cells at A7:F7, which are not mentioned in any of the four regions to be processed. I assumed these cells should remain unchanged, consistent with the behavior of the Bottom-Right region where the transformation was also skipped.",

For the Bottom-Left region (A10:G30), the instruction listed seeds (I17, J18, K19) and a corresponding seed list that were outside the region's boundaries.

The specific instructions describe a process where the Bottom-Left region inherits from the Top-Left, while the more fundamental rule implies the entire single Left region is filled based on its own seed. Both interpretations fortuitously lead to the same final grid, so I proceeded with that result.

There is a conceptual contradiction in the general instructions where a 'region' is defined as being composed of background cells but is also described as containing non-background 'seed' cells; I assumed that seeds are non-background, non-divider cells that are enclosed by or adjacent to a connected component of background cells. Finally, when a no-seed region was adjacent to multiple source regions in the highest-priority direction (e.g., 'Above'), I assumed that a region with its own primary seeds takes precedence as a source over a region that merely inherited its pattern.",

I followed the specific test instruction's list. 2) The instructions for the bottom half of the grid define logical regions and their corresponding seed lists in a way that conflicts with the primary partitioning rule (regions as 4-connected components of background). It appears that physically separate regions were logically grouped. To proceed, I assumed that all physical sub-regions belonging to a single logical group should be filled with spirals using the same shared seed list, but with each spiral's distance field calculated independently based on its own local boundaries.",
