However, an examination of the input grid shows that only column H is a complete vertical line of the divider color (1). Columns I, Q, and V contain other colors and are not simple vertical dividers. I proceeded by assuming the panel boundaries and regions defined in the step-by-step instructions (e.g., Panel 1 at A1:G30) were the intended logical partitions, even though they don't perfectly align with a strict definition of dividers based on the grid data. Additionally, some seed coordinates in the instructions for Panel 2 appeared to be off by one column (e.g., 'J17(4)' which is at I17, 'K18(9)' which is at J18, 'I8(2)' which was corrected to 'J8(2)' but is actually at I8). I followed the color sequences provided, which seem to be derived from the actual seed locations, assuming the coordinates in the instructions were typos.",
