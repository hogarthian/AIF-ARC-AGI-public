This region is filled with a solid spiral (fill) of green'. The specified region J11:T15 contains a vertical divider line segment (Q11:Q15) in the input grid. I assumed the specific instruction for the test case takes precedence, meaning the fill operation for the rectangular region overwrites the divider cells within it. This resolved the ambiguity.",
