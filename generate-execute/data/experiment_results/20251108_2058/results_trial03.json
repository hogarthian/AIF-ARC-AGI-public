I interpreted the 'simpler rule' ('a larger 4-connected non-divider component... the spiral fills this complex shape') by defining a bounding box for the entire component (J1:T20), generating a spiral fill for that box, and then applying those colors to only the background (blue) cells within the complex shape. This seemed the most robust way to apply a rectangular spiral algorithm to a non-rectangular area and produced a result consistent with the idea of the pattern propagating from the seeded sub-region.",

        "uncertainty": "The instructions were mostly clear, but there was a minor ambiguity in the definition of regions. For example, in Test T0, Region 2 was defined as `G1:M6`, which includes the divider line in column G. This created a situation where the inheritance rule for Region 3 (H8:M10) seemed contradictory. The general rule suggests inheritance should occur if column spans match. The actual fillable areas of Region 2 (columns H-M) and Region 3 (columns H-M) have matching column spans. However, the test instruction explicitly stated that the spans (`G-M` vs `H-M`) did not match and thus inheritance should not occur. I followed the specific test instruction, which resolved the ambiguity for this case, but the underlying definition of a region's span for the purpose of inheritance could be clarified.",

However, these regions do not seem to align perfectly with the regions formed by the divider lines as described in the general hypothesis. For instance, Region 6 spans across a vertical divider line, and its starting coordinate (G26) is part of a horizontal divider. I have proceeded by strictly adhering to the specified rectangular boundaries and only modifying the background-colored cells within them, assuming this was the intended interpretation despite the apparent inconsistency with the general partitioning rule.",

I had to make assumptions to resolve them based on the general hypothesis and the input grid's structure. Specifically: 1) Region coordinates in the instructions were frequently incorrect (e.g., 'A10:F29' for a region that clearly spans A10:G30). I corrected these based on the actual divider lines and seed locations. 2) Instructions for 'Region 4 (I10:P14)' and 'Region 6 (Q10:AD14)' were contradictory. One instruction stated I10:P14 was empty, while a note in another correctly placed a seed within it. Also, this area was split into multiple regions in the instructions without a corresponding divider line in the input. I chose to treat the entire area defined by the actual dividers (I10:AD15) as a single region and applied the general rules to it, which seemed the most logical approach.",

I followed the corrected rule, assuming it supersedes the first one. This could be a point of confusion. The generalization of a 'spiral fill' to a non-rectangular shape was interpreted as a layered fill based on distance from the shape's boundary, which seemed the most logical approach but was not explicitly defined in the general instructions.",

This assumption worked out because the fill logic correctly ignores non-background (i.e., divider) cells, so only the background parts of that row were affected as intended.",
