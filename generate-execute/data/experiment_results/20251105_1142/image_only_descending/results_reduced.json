I assumed the specific instruction's explicit seed list ([M15, N16]) was intended to override the general seed identification rule (which would have also included L14) and that \"O15\" was a typo for \"M15\". I confirmed this assumption by verifying the example calculation for cell N15, which only works with the seed at M15.
