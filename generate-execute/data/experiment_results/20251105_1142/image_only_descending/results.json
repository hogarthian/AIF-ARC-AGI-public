However, inspection of the input grid revealed a second seed, a teal cell at T1. Following the general instructions to identify all non-background cells as seeds, I treated both S2 and T1 as seeds for this region and colored the background based on the closest one, which is a more complex pattern than the one described in the specific instructions. 4. **Region Definition Ambiguity:** The general instructions define regions by contiguous areas of background color. For the test case, the entire left side (columns A-H) is one contiguous blue area. However, the specific test instructions divide this into a 'top-left' region (which gets colored) and a 'bottom-left' region (which does not).
