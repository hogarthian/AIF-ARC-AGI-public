      "uncertainty": "The instructions for the test case were mostly clear, but there were two points of ambiguity. First, in Region 1, the provided color list `[green(3), yellow(4)]` seemed to contradict the general seed ordering rule of 'top-to-bottom, left-to-right', as the yellow seed at G1 is positioned before the green seed at F2. I followed the explicitly provided list. Second, for Region 5, the listed seeds (I17, J18, K19) were not directly adjacent (8-way) to the fillable region (A17:G30) as they were separated by a wall of blue pixels. To resolve this, I had to assume that for the purpose of finding seeds, adjacency can cross a one-pixel-thick wall, or that the specific instructions for the test case simply override the general adjacency rule. I followed the specific instructions and used the listed seeds.",

These lists contradicted the seed ordering rule (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) that was consistently observed in all training examples and other test case regions. I chose to follow the consistent ordering rule rather than the provided lists. Specifically, for Region 1, I used `[yellow(4), green(3)]` instead of `[green(3), yellow(4)]`, and for Region 3, I used `[magenta(6), gray(5), yellow(4)]` instead of `[yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6)]`. Additionally, the partitioning of the grid into regions 5, 6, and 7 in the test instructions was inconsistent with the general hypothesis of regions being contiguous areas separated by walls, as these areas appeared to be connected. I proceeded by applying the transformations to the specified rectangular areas as instructed, assuming this partitioning was intentional.",
