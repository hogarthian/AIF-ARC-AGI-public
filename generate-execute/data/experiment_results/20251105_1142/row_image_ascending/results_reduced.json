First, the instruction for 'Region 5 (bottom-left, A17:H30)' appears to misidentify the region, as the specified seeds (I17, J18, K19) are adjacent to the teal area at I17:P30. I assumed I17:P30 was the correct region, which implied the existence of an unmentioned eighth region (A17:G30) that, having no seeds, remains unchanged. Second, the seed color order listed in the specific instructions for Region 1 ([green(3), yellow(4)]) and Region 3 ([yellow(4), gray(5), magenta(6)]) contradicts the general rule of ordering seeds by position (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). I followed the general rule, resulting in the orders [yellow(4), green(3)] for Region 1 and [magenta(6), gray(5), yellow(4)] for Region 3, assuming the specific instructions had an error.",

I have proceeded by strictly adhering to the specified regions as defined in the test case instructions (e.g., \"Region 1\" is all green cells in columns A-K, \"Region 2\" is all green cells in the M1:T7 rectangle, etc.), and applied the corresponding transformations only to the green cells within those specific geometric boundaries.
