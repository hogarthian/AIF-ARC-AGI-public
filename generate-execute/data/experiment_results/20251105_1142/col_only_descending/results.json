Second, the instructions for Region 2 specified seed locations (P16, S19, T20) that were incorrect according to the provided input grid data (which has seeds at P11, S2, T1). I chose to follow the logic of the instructions but used the actual grid data, which fortunately led to the same conclusion about the bounding box location. Third, the instruction for Region 2's interior, 'tiled green/yellow interior', was ambiguous. A simple tiling of the fill seed pattern was not feasible. Based on observing the pattern in example E0, I formulated a 'nested border' hypothesis: the highest-value fill color (yellow) forms an inner border, and the remaining color (green) provides a solid fill for the center.

Second, for Region 1, the instruction to create a 'complex shape' was ambiguous.

      "uncertainty": "I encountered several points of uncertainty where the specific instructions for the test case seemed to contradict either the input data or patterns observed in the training examples. I followed the test case instructions literally, as mandated by the experimental setup. The specific points are: 1. The instruction for Test T0, Region 2, stated the 'Seed BBox is L12:N16'. However, the input grid shows additional seeds at L1 and M2 which are outside this bounding box. I proceeded by ignoring these extra seeds and using only the ones within the specified BBox. 2. The instruction for T0, Region 2, defined the top-left quadrant as L1:P10. A consistent rule derived from all training examples (`floor(width/2)`) would define it as L1:O10. I used the specified L1:P10 for the check, noting that the outcome (BBox is outside the quadrant) remained the same. 3. The input grid for T0 contains a horizontal red line segment in Region 2 (from K13-T13). The instructions for T0 did not mention this line or its potential effect (e.g., subdividing the region, as seen in example E2). I treated Region 2 as a single, undivided region and assumed the red cells of this line were not part of the tiling pattern. 4. The instruction for T0, Region 1, specified the output should be 'a complex E shape' without giving exact dimensions. I inferred a plausible block 'E' shape that fits within the region with a 1-pixel margin, consistent with the style seen in training examples.",
