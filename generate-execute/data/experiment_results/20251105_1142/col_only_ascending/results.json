To resolve this contradiction, I disregarded the incorrect seed list from the specific instructions and instead applied the general instructions to derive the correct seed list directly from the input grid.

Furthermore, the sorted seed list in step 5c was not sorted according to the rule specified in the general instructions (first by row, then by column). Due to these discrepancies, I chose to ignore the erroneous specific instructions for step 5 and instead applied the general algorithm from the Working Hypothesis directly to the test input grid. This involved identifying the seed cells from the grid data itself, sorting them correctly, and then performing the nearest-seed coloring calculation.
