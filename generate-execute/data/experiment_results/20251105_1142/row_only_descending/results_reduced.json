Secondly, the instructions for the left region ('G') omitted a color for the letter's hole, despite the general instructions specifying a rule for hole colors (C[2]) and the provided palette having a C[2] color. To resolve this, I designed a pixel art stencil for 'G' that had no fully enclosed hole, coloring all non-letter background areas within the border with the border color (C[0]). Lastly, the exact font, size, and scaling method for the letters were not specified. I inferred a plausible size (10x7 for 'G', 10x10 for 'H') and a centering method based on the grid dimensions that resulted in integer padding values.
