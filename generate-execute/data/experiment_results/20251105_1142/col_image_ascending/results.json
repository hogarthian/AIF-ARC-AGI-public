I followed the instruction's intent to treat this shape as a barrier that partitions the region into an 'inside' (which gets filled with the content's color) and an 'outside' (which gets a spiral fill). 3) The instructions mention the shape's bounding box as J10:Q17, but the data shows the shape only extends to row/column 16.

I proceeded by following the instruction's logic: I used the list of seeds and colors provided in the instruction to generate the spiral fill pattern for the specified bounding box. Then, as a final step, I applied the general rule to 'preserve all original non-background pixels', using the actual JSON input grid as the source for these pixels.

Specifically, the list of non-background 'shape' pixels provided in instruction T0.3 (L12(8), M13(1), L13(5), M15(0), N16(1)) did not match the actual non-background pixels in the input grid's right-hand region. For example, the instruction lists M13 as having color 1, but it is background color 4 in the input. Conversely, the input grid contains several non-background pixels not mentioned in the instructions, such as a horizontal red line at row 13. I proceeded by making the assumption that the instructions were the primary source of truth for generating the fill pattern. Therefore, I used the list of 'seeds' from the instructions to determine the spiral's color sequence. However, I followed the general rule to preserve all original non-background pixels from the actual input grid, overlaying them on top of the generated fill. This seemed the most logical way to reconcile the conflicting information.",
