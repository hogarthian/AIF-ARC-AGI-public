I used the position P11 for the 'content' pixel. 2) The instruction mentions the shape's bounding box as 'J10:Q17'. Based on the red pixels in the grid, the actual bounding box is J10:Q16. I used the bounding box derived from the grid data. 3) The instruction to fill the 'sub-region outside the shape's bounding box' with a spiral was slightly ambiguous for a non-rectangular region. I interpreted this as performing the spiral fill on the entire parent region (J1:T20) and then separately filling the 'inside' sub-region (K11:P15), which overwrites the spiral fill in that specific area. This seemed the most logical interpretation of sub-regions created by a barrier.",

The specified bounding box for the fill ('L12:T20') did not align with the locations of the seed pixels, some of which were in rows 1 and 2. 3. The test instructions ignored the presence of a horizontal red line at row 13, which, according to the general instructions, should have acted as a shape boundary, splitting the right region into two sub-regions. I chose to follow the test instructions as literally as possible, assuming the coordinates were typos but the color list `[8, 1, 5, 0, 1]` and the fill area `L12:T20` were correct. This meant ignoring the general rule about sub-regions created by shapes and filling only a portion of the right-hand region, leaving the top part unfilled.",
