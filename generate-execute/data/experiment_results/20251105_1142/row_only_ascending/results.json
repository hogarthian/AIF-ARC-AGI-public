The instructions for Vertical Column 1 (VC1) listed seed colors for regions that were located outside the boundaries of those regions. I followed the provided seed list, assuming this was an intended part of the pattern. 2. The instruction for region A10:G15 listed a sequence of five frame colors for a region that could geometrically only fit two frames. I assumed this instruction was erroneous and instead applied the general pattern-framing rule I derived from the examples, which resulted in a pattern of `Frame(7), Frame(6), Fill(5)`. 3. The instruction for Vertical Column 2 (VC2) stated that all its sub-regions had 'no seeds', which directly contradicted the input grid data.

For region A10:G15, which had 5 seed colors but only space for 3 frames, I assumed the instruction means to draw as many frames as possible in descending color order, and then fill the remaining center with the highest-value color (sk), truncating the list of frame colors.",
