Following the general instructions, these two sub-panels should be processed independently. The top sub-panel has 2 seeds (mapping to 'A') and the bottom has 3 seeds (mapping to 'R'). I chose to follow the general instructions and the visual evidence of the barrier, as this provided a more consistent and unambiguous interpretation of the rules. I therefore drew an 'A' and an 'R' instead of an 'S'.

'S' Letter Seed Distribution: The hypothesis suggested an 'S' corresponds to a 2/3 seed split between sub-panels. The bottom-right panel had a 3/2 split, but the instruction still mandated drawing an 'S'. I followed the instruction, suggesting the hypothesis is a guideline rather than a strict rule. 3. Letter Geometry and Coloring: The instructions did not specify the exact size, placement, or style of the letters to be drawn, nor the precise method for applying multiple colors to the parts of a single letter (like the 5-colored 'S'). I assumed the letters should be standard, centered, block-style shapes.
