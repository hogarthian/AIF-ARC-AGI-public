However, the grid contains other small regions of the background color (blue, 1) that are also separated by the boundary lines. I assumed these unmentioned partitions should be handled by the general instruction 5a, which states that partitions with an empty seed set should be left unchanged. Consequently, these regions remained blue in the final output. The instructions could be slightly clearer by stating that any partition not explicitly mentioned should be processed according to the general rules.",

I assumed that when the inner rectangle to be outlined has a width or height of 2 or less, it should be flood-filled with the current layer's color. This ensures the entire area is filled without any leftover holes. 2. The method for applying a pattern to the non-rectangular partition P5 was ambiguous. The instruction 'copying P2's pattern' was interpreted as generating a spiral within the bounding box of P5 (J10:T20) and then overwriting this pattern with the interior boundaries (red lines) and the interior partition (P3), as this seemed the most logical way to handle the complex shape.",

Additionally, some partition coordinates/names in the instructions (e.g., P6 'I10:Q15', P8 'I17:Q30') were imprecise as they included boundary lines or spanned multiple distinct regions.
