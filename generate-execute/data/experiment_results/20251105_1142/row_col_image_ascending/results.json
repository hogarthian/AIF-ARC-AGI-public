I also interpreted 'copying a pattern' for the rectangular partition P4 to mean using the same color sequence and spiral direction as its counterpart P1, but adapting the spiral generation to P4's own dimensions and starting corner.",

The term 'symmetric layout' was potentially ambiguous as the partitions were not geometrically identical, but the instructions immediately clarified the specific inheritance rule to apply, which removed the ambiguity.",

However, inspecting the input grid reveals that column G is a boundary in that region, and the actual partition containing the relevant seed (at I28) is H27:S30, which has an area of 48. According to the general rules, an area of 48 should result in a spiral pattern, not a flood-fill.

Column G in this area (G27:G30) is part of a static boundary line (color 8), which the general rules state should remain unchanged. The instruction to 'Flood-fill' P17 created a conflict. I resolved this by assuming 'Flood-fill' applies only to non-boundary cells within the specified region, thus only changing cells in H27:I30. Additionally, the instruction for partition P7 defined a region R9:T14, which does not align with the larger visually-bounded area of S9:W14. I followed the explicit region from the instructions.",
