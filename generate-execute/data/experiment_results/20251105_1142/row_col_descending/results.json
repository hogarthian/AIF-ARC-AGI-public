Single-Object Rule: The instruction for region H1:M10 specified an orange(7) glyph on an orange(7) background. This would render the glyph invisible. The training examples were also inconsistent on this rule (E0 output was a solid rectangle, while E1 was a filled glyph). I assumed the instruction implies filling the entire bounding box (H1:M7) with a solid orange(7) color, consistent with the E0 output, even though the instruction mentioned a '7' glyph. 3. Separator Integrity: The instruction for region H1:M10 specified a bounding box (H1:M7) that overlaps with a part of the magenta(6) separator line (H7:M7).

Filling H1:M7 with orange would overwrite this part of the line. I assumed that the rule 'the dividing line remains unchanged' has higher precedence. Therefore, I treated the magenta 'L' shape as the full partition, creating two separate regions to the right: H1:M6 and H8:M10.
