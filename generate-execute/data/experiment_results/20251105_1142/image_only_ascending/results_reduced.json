This discrepancy affected the 'smallest size' rule for selecting a primary seed, but due to the tie-breaking rule, the final outcome for palettes was the same. Second, the instructions referred to a single 'BL' (Bottom-Left) region, but the partitioning lines divide this area into two non-contiguous rectangular sub-regions.

These inaccuracies did not affect the final outcome for this specific test case due to the tie-breaking rules, but they could in other scenarios. Additionally, the instructions state the grid is partitioned into four regions, but the partition lines in the input form a complex shape including a rectangle entirely within the Bottom-Right region.

Palette Derivation: The palettes specified in the instructions ({3,4} for TL, {2,9} for BR, {4,5} for BL) do not match the palettes that would be derived by applying the general Mode B rule to the actual seeds in the grid.

This means I used the simplified four-quadrant model and the provided palettes for the spiral fill, ignoring the actual seeds present in the grid. I also assumed that each distinct, contiguous region bounded by partition lines gets its own independent spiral fill, with the palette determined by which of the four major quadrants it resides in.
