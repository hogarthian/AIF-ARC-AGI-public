      "description": "Of course. Here is a detailed visual analysis of the provided puzzle grid.\n\n### Color Mapping\n- **3 = Green**\n- **2 = Red**\n- **1 = Blue**\n\n### Grid Structure\n- **Dimensions**: The grid is a rectangle with 5 rows and 13 columns (5x13).\n- **Composition**: The entire grid is filled with colored cells. There are no empty (black/0) cells.\n- **Overall Layout**: The grid has a nested, concentric structure. It consists of a large outer frame, a smaller inner frame, and a central pattern of individual cells.\n\n### Objects and Shapes\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame**: The outermost object is a solid, 1-cell thick frame made of green (3) cells. It encloses the entire 5x13 grid.\n2.  **Inner Red Rectangle**: Nested inside the green frame is a hollow, 1-cell thick rectangle made of red (2) cells. This rectangle has dimensions of 3 rows by 11 columns.\n3.  **Central Blue and Green Cells**: Inside the hollow space of the red rectangle, along the central third row, is a sequence of individual blue (1) and green (3) cells. These are all 1x1 in size.\n    - There are four distinct blue cells.\n    - There are five distinct green cells in this central sequence.\n\n### Locations (using spreadsheet notation A1-M5)\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame (3)**:\n    - **Top Row (R1)**: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1.\n    - **Bottom Row (R5)**: A5, B5, C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, H5, I5, J5, K5, L5, M5.\n    - **Left Column (A)**: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5.\n    - **Right Column (M)**: M1, M2, M3, M4, M5.\n\n2.  **Inner Red Rectangle (2)**:\n    - **Top Side (R2)**: B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2.\n    - **Bottom Side (R4)**: B4, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L4.\n    - **Left Side (in R3)**: B3.\n    - **Right Side (in R3)**: L3.\n\n3.  **Central Pattern Cells (in R3)**:\n    - **Blue (1) Cells**: Located at C3, E3, G3, and K3.\n    - **Green (3) Cells**: Located at D3, F3, H3, I3, and J3.\n\n### Colors\n\n- **Green (3)**: This is the most prevalent color. It forms the complete outer border of the grid and also appears as separator cells in the central pattern (D3, F3, H3, I3, J3).\n- **Red (2)**: This color forms the inner rectangular frame, perfectly separating the outer green frame from the central pattern.\n- **Blue (1)**: This color is the least frequent and appears only as four single cells within the centermost row (C3, E3, G3, K3).\n\n### Relationships\n\n- **Spatial & Structural**:\n    - The structure is concentric and nested: The red rectangle is perfectly centered inside the green frame, with a uniform 1-cell gap between them on all sides.\n    - The central pattern of blue and green cells is located entirely within the hollow area of the red rectangle, specifically along the grid's horizontal midline (Row 3).\n    - The cells in the central pattern (C3 to K3) are arranged adjacently in a horizontal line.\n\n- **Color**:\n    - The colors are layered from the outside in: Green -> Red -> (Blue/Green pattern).\n    - The blue cells in the central pattern are always separated by one or more green cells.\n\n- **Size**:\n    - The green frame is the largest object (5x13 perimeter).\n    - The red rectangle is the next largest (3x11 perimeter).\n    - The blue and central green objects are the smallest, all being single 1x1 cells.\n\n### Patterns and Symmetries\n\n- **Horizontal Symmetry**: The grid is perfectly symmetrical across its horizontal axis (between rows 2 and 4, with row 3 as the center).\n    - Row 1 is identical to Row 5.\n    - Row 2 is identical to Row 4.\n- **Central Pattern Repetition**: The pattern in the center (Row 3, from C3 to K3) is `1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1` (Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Green, Green, Blue).\n    - There is a repeating `Blue, Green` motif that occurs three times initially (C3-D3, E3-F3, G3-H3).\n    - The spacing between the first three blue cells (C3, E3, G3) is regular, with one green cell separating each.\n    - The spacing between the third (G3) and fourth (K3) blue cells is larger, with three green cells (H3, I3, J3) separating them. This breaks the simple repetition.\n\n### Details\n\n- The central row (Row 3) contains the most unique information in the grid. Its specific sequence is: `3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3`.\n- The overall visual impression is that of a stylized container or a digital display element, with the outer frames providing a boundary for the inner \"data\" or pattern."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n### **Color Mapping**\n- 1 = blue\n- 2 = red\n- 3 = green\n\n### **1. Objects and Shapes**\nThe grid contains several distinct geometric shapes and objects, primarily nested rectangular frames and individual pixels arranged in a line.\n\n- **Outer Frame:** A large, solid, rectangular frame that forms the border of the entire grid. It is one cell thick.\n- **Inner Frame:** A smaller, solid, rectangular frame is perfectly centered inside the outer frame. It is also one cell thick.\n- **Central Line of Pixels:** A horizontal line of individual colored pixels is located in the absolute center of the grid, inside the inner frame. This line is composed of:\n    - Four individual blue (1) pixels.\n    - Five individual green (3) pixels. Three of these green pixels are contiguous, forming a 3x1 horizontal bar.\n\n### **2. Locations**\nThe grid is 5 rows by 13 columns. Using spreadsheet notation (A1 is top-left, M5 is bottom-right):\n\n- **Outer Green (3) Frame:**\n    - **Top edge:** A1 to M1.\n    - **Bottom edge:** A5 to M5.\n    - **Left edge:** A1 to A5.\n    - **Right edge:** M1 to M5.\n\n- **Inner Red (2) Frame:**\n    - **Top edge:** B2 to L2.\n    - **Bottom edge:** B4 to L4.\n    - **Left edge:** B2 to B4.\n    - **Right edge:** L2 to L4.\n\n- **Central Pixels (all in Row 3):**\n    - **Blue (1) Pixels:** Located at C3, E3, G3, and K3.\n    - **Green (3) Pixels:** Located at D3, F3, H3, I3, and J3.\n\n### **3. Colors**\nThree colors are present in the grid:\n\n- **Green (3):** This is the most prevalent color. It forms the entire 13x5 outer frame and also appears as a set of five pixels along the central horizontal axis (D3, F3, H3, I3, J3).\n- **Red (2):** This color exclusively forms the 11x3 inner frame, which is nested within the green frame.\n- **Blue (1):** This color appears as four single, separated pixels (C3, E3, G3, K3) along the central horizontal axis.\n\n### **4. Relationships**\n- **Spatial & Structural:**\n    - **Nesting:** The red frame is perfectly nested inside the green frame. There is a uniform one-cell-wide gap separating the two frames on all sides.\n    - **Containment:** All blue (1) and internal green (3) pixels are located on the central row (Row 3) and are fully contained within the boundaries of the inner red frame.\n    - **Adjacency:** Along Row 3, the blue and green pixels are arranged in a specific sequence. For example, the blue pixel at C3 is adjacent to the red frame on its left (B3) and a green pixel on its right (D3). The green pixels from H3 to J3 are contiguous, forming a solid 3x1 bar.\n\n- **Size:**\n    - The outer green frame has dimensions of 13x5.\n    - The inner red frame has dimensions of 11x3.\n    - All blue and green objects in the center are 1x1 pixels in size.\n\n### **5. Patterns**\n- **Symmetry:**\n    - **Horizontal Symmetry:** The grid is perfectly symmetrical across its horizontal midline (Row 3). Row 1 is identical to Row 5, and Row 2 is identical to Row 4.\n    - **Vertical Asymmetry:** The grid is *almost* perfectly symmetrical across its vertical midline (Column G). The outer green frame and inner red frame are symmetrical. The pattern of pixels in Row 3, however, has a single point of asymmetry. Comparing the left side to the right side (relative to Column G):\n        - C3 (blue) is symmetrical with K3 (blue).\n        - D3 (green) is symmetrical with J3 (green).\n        - F3 (green) is symmetrical with H3 (green).\n        - **The break in symmetry occurs at E3 (blue) and its counterpart I3 (green).** If I3 were blue, the grid would be perfectly symmetrical.\n\n- **Repetition:**\n    - In the left half of Row 3 (from C3 to G3), there is a distinct alternating pattern of `blue, green, blue, green, blue`. This pattern is not mirrored on the right side.\n\n### **6. Grid Structure**\n- **Dimensions:** The grid is 5 rows tall and 13 columns wide.\n- **Composition:** The grid is completely filled with colored cells. There are no empty or background (0) cells.\n- **Boundaries:** The structure is defined by two clear, nested rectangular boundaries (frames).\n\n### **7. Details**\n- The most significant feature of the grid is the single point of broken symmetry at cell I3.\n- The central row (Row 3) contains all the unique and complex information, while the surrounding rows (1, 2, 4, 5) form a simple, regular, and symmetrical container.\n- The arrangement of pixels in the center could be interpreted as a code or a representation of a state, like lights on a display panel. The sequence is: `(red frame) blue, green, blue, green, blue, green, green, green, green, blue (red frame)`."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a detailed visual analysis of the provided puzzle grid.\n\n### **Color Mapping**\n\nThe provided numbers map to the following colors:\n- 3 = green\n- 2 = red\n- 1 = blue\n\nThe number 0 (black/background) is not present in this grid.\n\n### **Grid Structure**\n\n*   **Dimensions**: The grid is a rectangle with dimensions of 5 rows and 13 columns.\n*   **Overall Structure**: The grid is fully populated with colored cells. It has a distinct nested, frame-like structure.\n*   **Boundaries**: The outermost edge of the grid is a solid green border, one cell thick.\n\n### **Objects and Shapes**\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame**: A hollow rectangle made of green (3) cells. It forms the perimeter of the entire 5x13 grid.\n2.  **Inner Red Rectangle**: A hollow rectangle made of red (2) cells, nested inside the green frame. It has a horizontal line of red cells dividing its interior.\n3.  **Discrete Pixels**: Several individual blue (1) and green (3) cells are located on the central horizontal axis of the grid.\n\n### **Locations**\n\nCoordinates are given in spreadsheet notation (ColumnLetter, RowNumber).\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame (Color 3)**:\n    *   **Top Edge**: A1 to M1 (3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3)\n    *   **Bottom Edge**: A5 to M5 (3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3)\n    *   **Left Edge**: A1 to A5 (3,3,3,3,3)\n    *   **Right Edge**: M1 to M5 (3,3,3,3,3)\n\n2.  **Inner Red Rectangle (Color 2)**:\n    *   This shape is located within the green frame, occupying the area from B2 to L4.\n    *   **Top Edge**: B2 to L2 (2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)\n    *   **Bottom Edge**: B4 to L4 (2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)\n    *   **Left Edge**: The cells B2, B3, B4.\n    *   **Right Edge**: The cells L2, L3, L4.\n\n3.  **Central Row Pixels (Row 3)**:\n    *   This is the most complex row, located between the top and bottom red lines of the inner rectangle.\n    *   **Blue Pixels (Color 1)**: Located at C3, E3, G3, and K3.\n    *   **Green Pixels (Color 3)**: Located at D3, F3, H3, I3, and J3.\n    *   **Red Pixels (Color 2)**: Located at B3 and L3, forming the vertical sides of the inner red rectangle.\n\n### **Colors**\n\n*   **Green (3)**: This color is used for the outermost 1-cell thick frame and for five individual pixels on the central row (D3, F3, H3, I3, J3).\n*   **Red (2)**: This color forms the inner rectangular structure. It makes up two solid horizontal lines (rows 2 and 4, from column B to L) and the vertical connectors at B3 and L3.\n*   **Blue (1)**: This color appears only as four discrete, single pixels on the central row at C3, E3, G3, and K3.\n\n### **Relationships**\n\n*   **Spatial & Structural**:\n    *   The grid exhibits a clear **nested** or **concentric** structure. The outer green frame completely encloses the inner red structure.\n    *   The inner red structure, in turn, encloses a sequence of blue and green pixels on row 3.\n    *   The red lines at row 2 and row 4 are parallel and separated by one row (row 3).\n    *   The blue and green pixels on row 3 are all **adjacent** to each other, forming a horizontal sequence.\n\n*   **Color**:\n    *   The framing colors (green and red) are distinct from each other.\n    *   The pixels inside the red frame are a mix of blue and green. The green of the inner pixels is the same color as the outer frame.\n\n### **Patterns**\n\n*   **Framing Pattern**: The grid has a double-frame structure (green frame, then red frame).\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   The overall frame structure is vertically and horizontally symmetrical. The green frame and the red horizontal bars (rows 2 and 4) are perfectly symmetrical around the central row and central column.\n    *   However, the pattern of pixels on the central row (row 3) is **asymmetrical**.\n*   **Repetition on Row 3**:\n    *   The left side of the inner part of row 3 (from C3 to H3) shows a repeating alternating pattern: `blue, green, blue, green, blue, green` (1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3).\n    *   The right side of this row (from I3 to K3) breaks this pattern with the sequence `green, green, blue` (3, 3, 1).\n\n### **Details**\n\n*   The central row (Row 3) is the primary focus of complexity and uniqueness in the grid. Its sequence, from left to right inside the frame, is: `1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1`.\n*   The structure can be interpreted as a container or a box (the green and red frames) holding a specific code or sequence of items (the blue and green pixels).\n*   The transition from the repeating `1, 3` pattern to the `3, 3, 1` block is a significant feature. The block of three green pixels (H3, I3, J3) is a notable anomaly in the otherwise alternating pattern."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a detailed visual analysis of the provided puzzle grid.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe analysis uses the following color mapping for the numeric values in the grid:\n- **3** = Green\n- **2** = Red\n- **1** = Blue\n\n### Grid Structure\n- **Dimensions**: The grid is a rectangle with 5 rows and 13 columns.\n- **Boundaries**: The grid is completely filled with colored cells. The outermost cells form a distinct, one-cell-thick green frame.\n- **Background**: There is no background color (value 0) present; every cell is filled.\n\n### Objects and Shapes\nThe grid contains a primary structure of nested rectangles with some internal pixel-level details.\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame**: A hollow rectangle, one cell thick, made entirely of green pixels. It defines the perimeter of the entire grid.\n2.  **Inner Red Area**: A large, mostly red rectangular area is nested inside the green frame. This area spans 11 columns (B to L) and 3 rows (2 to 4).\n3.  **Individual Pixels**: Within the central row of the inner red area, there are several individual green and blue pixels that interrupt the red color.\n\n### Locations\nCoordinates are given in spreadsheet format (ColumnLetter, RowNumber).\n\n-   **Green Frame**:\n    -   **Top Edge**: A1 to M1.\n    -   **Bottom Edge**: A5 to M5.\n    -   **Left Edge**: A1 to A5.\n    -   **Right Edge**: M1 to M5.\n\n-   **Inner Red Area**: This area occupies the rectangle from B2 to L4.\n    -   **Top Row (Row 2)**: A solid line of red cells from B2 to L2.\n    -   **Bottom Row (Row 4)**: A solid line of red cells from B4 to L4.\n    -   **Central Row (Row 3)**: This row is primarily red but is punctuated by other colored cells. The red cells are located at B3 and L3.\n\n-   **Blue Pixels (1)**: There are four single blue pixels, all located on Row 3 at the following coordinates:\n    -   C3\n    -   E3\n    -   G3\n    -   K3\n\n-   **Internal Green Pixels (3)**: There are five single green pixels located inside the red area, all on Row 3, at these coordinates:\n    -   D3\n    -   F3\n    -   H3\n    -   I3\n    -   J3\n\n### Colors\n-   **Green (3)**: This is the framing color. It forms the entire 1-cell thick border of the 5x13 grid and also appears as five individual pixels on the central row (Row 3).\n-   **Red (2)**: This is the primary fill color for the inner region. It forms two solid horizontal lines at Row 2 and Row 4, and appears at the start and end of the inner section of Row 3 (B3 and L3).\n-   **Blue (1)**: This color appears only as four individual pixels, all located on Row 3, interspersed with the other colors.\n\n### Relationships\n-   **Spatial & Structural**:\n    -   The main structure is one of **nesting**. The large red area is perfectly centered and enclosed within the green frame, with a one-cell gap between them on all sides.\n    -   The blue and internal green pixels are all **collinear**, lying on the horizontal line of Row 3.\n    -   The cells on Row 3, from C3 to K3, form a sequence of alternating and grouped colors.\n\n-   **Color**:\n    -   The green of the frame is the same color as the pixels interrupting the red area on Row 3.\n    -   The red area is mostly uniform, with the exception of the single line of multi-colored pixels on Row 3.\n\n### Patterns\n-   **Symmetry**: The overall shape exhibits strong horizontal symmetry. The top half (Rows 1-2) is a mirror image of the bottom half (Rows 5-4). However, the specific color pattern on the central axis (Row 3) is **asymmetrical**.\n    -   For example, the pixel at E3 is blue (1), while its horizontally mirrored counterpart at I3 is green (3).\n-   **Repetition**: On the left side of Row 3, there is an alternating pattern of `blue, green, blue, green, blue` starting at C3 and ending at G3 (`1, 3, 1, 3, 1`). This pattern is broken on the right side of the row.\n\n### Details\n-   The structure resembles a stylized representation of a container, box, or a digital display screen.\n-   The central row (Row 3) is the most complex and information-dense part of the grid. Its specific, asymmetrical sequence of blue and green pixels (`1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1`) suggests it might represent a code, a specific state, or a unique identifier within the larger, simpler structure.\n-   The grid is horizontally elongated (13 columns vs. 5 rows)."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe colors in the grid correspond to the following numeric values:\n- **Green**: 3\n- **Red**: 2\n- **Blue**: 1\n- **White/Light Gray**: Not specified in the mapping, but present as small symbols in every cell.\n\n### 1. Objects and Shapes\nThe grid contains several distinct objects and shapes:\n\n*   **Large Red Hollow Rectangle**: A prominent, centrally-located rectangular frame.\n    *   **Outer Boundary**: Extends from cell B2 to L4.\n    *   **Inner Boundary**: The hollow space is located on row 3, from C3 to K3.\n    *   **Form**: It is composed of a top horizontal bar (11 cells wide), a bottom horizontal bar (11 cells wide), and two single-cell vertical \"caps\" on the left and right ends that connect the bars.\n*   **Blue Rectangular Blocks**: Three separate, solid blue rectangular blocks are located inside the hollow part of the red rectangle.\n    *   **Block 1 (Left)**: A 3x1 rectangle.\n    *   **Block 2 (Center)**: A 2x1 rectangle.\n    *   **Block 3 (Right)**: A 1x1 square.\n*   **Green Background**: This color fills all the space not occupied by the red and blue shapes.\n*   **White Symbols**: A small, white (or very light gray) symbol is present in **every single cell** of the grid. This symbol is a small square with a diagonal line running from its top-left corner to its bottom-right corner.\n\n### 2. Locations\nThe grid uses an A-M column and A-A row labeling. For clarity, I will refer to the rows as 1 through 5 from top to bottom.\n\n*   **Red Hollow Rectangle**:\n    *   **Top Bar**: Occupies cells B2 through L2.\n    *   **Bottom Bar**: Occupies cells B4 through L4.\n    *   **Left Connector**: Occupies cell B3.\n    *   **Right Connector**: Occupies cell L3.\n*   **Blue Rectangular Blocks**: All are located on row 3.\n    *   **Block 1**: Occupies cells C3, D3, and E3.\n    *   **Block 2**: Occupies cells G3 and H3.\n    *   **Block 3**: Occupies cell K3.\n*   **Green Background**:\n    *   **Top Border**: The entire first row (A1 to M1).\n    *   **Bottom Border**: The entire fifth row (A5 to M5).\n    *   **Side Borders**: Column A (cells A2, A3, A4) and Column M (cells M2, M3, M4).\n    *   **Internal Gaps**: The cells separating the blue blocks on row 3: F3, I3, and J3.\n\n### 3. Colors\n*   **Green (3)**: This is the background color, framing the central structure and filling the gaps between the blue blocks.\n*   **Red (2)**: This color forms the large, hollow rectangular shape that acts as a container for the blue blocks.\n*   **Blue (1)**: This color is used for the three distinct blocks inside the red frame.\n*   **White**: This color is used for the small, repeating symbol found in every cell, superimposed on the background color of that cell.\n\n### 4. Relationships\n*   **Spatial Relationships**:\n    *   The red rectangle is nested within the green background.\n    *   The three blue blocks are nested within the hollow space of the red rectangle.\n    *   The blue blocks are horizontally aligned on the central row (row 3).\n    *   The blue blocks are separated from each other by green cells. The first gap (at F3) is 1 cell wide, and the second gap (at I3-J3) is 2 cells wide.\n*   **Size Relationships**:\n    *   The red rectangle is the largest single connected object.\n    *   The blue blocks decrease in size from left to right (3 cells, then 2 cells, then 1 cell).\n*   **Color Relationships**:\n    *   The grid uses three primary colors (green, red, blue) for its main structures.\n    *   The white symbol is a constant element, appearing on top of every background color.\n*   **Structural Relationships**:\n    *   The red shape is a single, continuous, closed loop (a frame).\n    *   The blue shapes are three discrete, separate objects.\n\n### 5. Patterns\n*   **Repetition**: The most obvious pattern is the repetition of the small white symbol in every cell of the 5x13 grid.\n*   **Progression/Sequence**: There is a clear numerical pattern in the sizes of the blue blocks and the gaps between them, moving from left to right.\n    *   **Blue Block Sizes**: 3, 2, 1. This is a decreasing arithmetic sequence.\n    *   **Green Gap Sizes**: 1, 2. This is an increasing arithmetic sequence.\n*   **Symmetry**:\n    *   The red rectangle is perfectly symmetrical across the horizontal axis (row 3).\n    *   The overall composition of blue and green cells within the red frame is asymmetrical due to the varying sizes of the blocks and gaps.\n\n### 6. Grid Structure\n*   **Dimensions**: The grid is 5 rows by 13 columns.\n*   **Composition**: The entire grid is filled with colored cells; there are no empty (black/0) cells.\n*   **Background**: The effective background of the entire grid is green, forming a one-cell-thick border around the central red and blue structure.\n*   **Framing**: The central action of the puzzle is framed by a border of green cells on all four sides.\n\n### 7. Details\n*   **Coordinate Labels**: The image includes its own coordinate system. The columns are labeled A through M. Unusually, all rows are labeled 'A'.\n*   **Universal Symbol**: The presence of the identical white symbol in every cell is a highly significant detail. It suggests that the color of the cell is a property separate from the cell's fundamental state, which is represented by the symbol. This could imply that every cell is of the same \"type\" but has a different color \"value\"."

Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe colors present in the grid correspond to the following numeric values:\n- **Green (3)**: Background color.\n- **Red (2)**: The large central rectangle.\n- **Blue (1)**: The three small squares.\n- **White**: Used for the coordinate text overlay (not in the provided 0-9 mapping).\n\n### Grid Structure\n- **Dimensions**: The grid is 13 columns wide and 5 rows high. The columns are labeled A through M, and the rows are labeled 1 through 5.\n- **Background**: The entire grid has a uniform green (3) background, which also forms a 1-cell wide border around the central colored shapes.\n- **Labels**: A significant feature of the grid is a dense overlay of white text characters that indicate the coordinates of each cell.\n    - Each column has its letter identifier (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C') repeated vertically down the column.\n    - Each row has its number identifier (e.g., '1', '2', '3') repeated horizontally across the row.\n    - This results in each cell containing its own coordinate label (e.g., the cell at the intersection of column C and row 4 contains the text \"C4\").\n\n### Objects and Shapes\nThere are two primary types of colored objects within the green background:\n\n1.  **Large Red Rectangle**:\n    - **Form**: A solid, filled rectangle.\n    - **Size**: It is 11 cells wide and 3 cells high.\n    - **Boundaries**: Its top-left corner is at B2, and its bottom-right corner is at L4.\n\n2.  **Small Blue Squares**:\n    - **Form**: Three individual, 1x1 squares.\n    - **Size**: Each square is exactly one cell in size.\n\n### Locations\n- **Red Rectangle**: This rectangle is centrally located on the grid. It spans horizontally from column B to column L and vertically from row 2 to row 4.\n    - Top edge: Cells B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2.\n    - Middle row: Cells B3, C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, H3, I3, J3, K3, L3.\n    - Bottom edge: Cells B4, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L4.\n\n- **Blue Squares**: The three blue squares are located along the horizontal centerline of the red rectangle (in row 3).\n    - The first blue square is at **C3**.\n    - The second blue square is at **G3**.\n    - The third blue square is at **K3**.\n\n### Relationships\n- **Spatial & Structural**:\n    - **Nesting**: The objects have a nested structure. The three blue squares are embedded within the larger red rectangle, which in turn is embedded within the green background.\n    - **Centering**: The red rectangle is perfectly centered within the grid, leaving a 1-cell wide green border on all four sides (row 1, row 5, column A, and column M are all green).\n    - **Alignment**: The three blue squares are perfectly aligned horizontally along row 3.\n    - **Spacing**: The blue squares are spaced at regular intervals. There are exactly three red cells between each adjacent pair of blue squares.\n        - Between C3 and G3 are the red cells D3, E3, F3.\n        - Between G3 and K3 are the red cells H3, I3, J3.\n    - **Proximity**: The first blue square (C3) is one cell in from the left edge of the red rectangle. The last blue square (K3) is one cell in from the right edge of the red rectangle.\n\n- **Color**:\n    - The green (3) background contrasts with the red (2) rectangle.\n    - The blue (1) squares contrast with the red (2) rectangle they are embedded in.\n\n### Patterns\n- **Symmetry**: The arrangement of the colored shapes is perfectly symmetrical along the vertical axis of the grid, which runs down the middle of column G.\n    - The red rectangle is centered on this axis.\n    - The blue square at G3 lies directly on the axis of symmetry.\n    - The blue squares at C3 and K3 are mirror images of each other, each being 4 columns away from the central column G.\n- **Repetition**: There is a clear, repeating pattern in row 3, starting from column C and ending at column K: **[Blue, Red, Red, Red, Blue, Red, Red, Red, Blue]**. This pattern highlights the regular spacing of the blue squares.\n\n### Details\n- The most unusual detail is the white text overlay. The text is an integral part of the image, not just an external label. It is rendered in a simple, pixelated font and is present in every single cell of the 13x5 grid. This text explicitly defines the coordinate system for the puzzle."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the provided puzzle grid.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe colors in the grid correspond to the following numeric values:\n- **Green**: 3\n- **Red**: 2\n- **Blue**: 1\n- **White**: Used for text overlays, not part of the numeric color map.\n- **Black (0)**: Not present in the grid.\n\n### Grid Structure\n- **Dimensions**: The grid is 13 columns wide and 5 rows high (13x5).\n- **Coordinates**: The columns are labeled A through M, and the rows are labeled 1 through 5.\n- **Composition**: The entire grid is filled with colored cells. There are no empty (black) cells. The structure consists of nested rectangular shapes.\n- **Text Overlay**: A significant feature is that every single cell in the grid has a white text label corresponding to its spreadsheet coordinate (e.g., the top-left cell contains the text \"A1\", the cell below it contains \"A2\", etc.).\n\n### Objects and Shapes\nThe grid is composed of three distinct colored regions forming a nested structure:\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame**: A hollow rectangle, one cell thick, that forms the perimeter of the grid.\n2.  **Middle Red Rectangle**: A solid rectangle nested inside the green frame.\n3.  **Inner Blue Segments**: A series of five disconnected 1x1 blue squares arranged in a horizontal line within the red rectangle.\n\n### Locations\nThe precise locations of these objects are as follows:\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame (Color 3)**:\n    - **Top edge**: Occupies all cells in row 1, from A1 to M1.\n    - **Bottom edge**: Occupies all cells in row 5, from A5 to M5.\n    - **Left edge**: Occupies all cells in column A, from A1 to A5.\n    - **Right edge**: Occupies all cells in column M, from M1 to M5.\n\n2.  **Middle Red Rectangle (Color 2)**:\n    - This is a solid 11x3 rectangle located in the center of the grid.\n    - It spans from column B to column L and from row 2 to row 4.\n    - Its top-left corner is at B2, and its bottom-right corner is at L4.\n    - It completely fills this area, except for the cells that are blue.\n\n3.  **Inner Blue Segments (Color 1)**:\n    - These are five individual 1x1 blue cells.\n    - They are all located on the central row of the grid, row 3.\n    - Their specific coordinates are: **C3, E3, G3, I3, K3**.\n\n### Colors\n- **Green (3)**: Used exclusively for the 1-cell thick outer frame of the grid.\n- **Red (2)**: Fills the central 11x3 rectangular area, acting as a background for the blue segments.\n- **Blue (1)**: Appears as five distinct 1x1 squares along the horizontal centerline (row 3).\n- **White**: The color of the coordinate text labels present in every cell.\n\n### Relationships\n- **Spatial & Structural**:\n    - **Nesting**: The shapes are nested. The green frame encloses the red rectangle, and the red rectangle encloses the blue segments.\n    - **Adjacency**: The red rectangle is directly adjacent to the inner boundary of the green frame on all four sides. The blue segments are adjacent to red cells on all sides.\n    - **Alignment**: The blue segments are perfectly aligned horizontally along row 3.\n    - **Separation**: The blue segments are separated from each other by a single red cell. For example, cell D3 (red) is between C3 (blue) and E3 (blue).\n\n- **Size**:\n    - The green frame is 13x5 externally and 11x3 internally.\n    - The red rectangle is 11x3.\n    - Each blue segment is a 1x1 square.\n\n### Patterns\n- **Concentric Frames**: The green and red shapes form a pattern of two concentric rectangular frames.\n- **Periodic Repetition**: The blue cells exhibit a clear periodic pattern along row 3 within the red rectangle. Starting from column C, the pattern is `Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue`. The blue cells appear in every other column (C, E, G, I, K).\n- **Symmetry**: The overall color arrangement (ignoring the text) is perfectly symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.\n    - The horizontal axis of symmetry is row 3.\n    - The vertical axis of symmetry is column G.\n- **Coordinate Labeling**: There is a consistent and absolute pattern where every cell is explicitly labeled with its own coordinate in white text.\n\n### Details\n- The most unusual and defining detail is the coordinate text overlay. This suggests that the location of each cell is a primary piece of information for the puzzle.\n- The colors used are the first three in the provided mapping: 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 3 (green).\n- The structure is very orderly and geometric."

      "description": "Excellent. I am an expert at visual analysis and pattern recognition. Here is a detailed description of the puzzle grid you provided.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe colors in the grid correspond to the following numeric values:\n- **1**: Blue\n- **2**: Red\n- **3**: Green\n- **White**: Used for text labels (not assigned a number in the prompt).\n\n### Grid Structure\n- **Dimensions**: The grid is a rectangle with 5 rows and 13 columns, for a total of 65 cells. The coordinate system is explicitly labeled from A1 (top-left) to M5 (bottom-right).\n- **Overall Layout**: The grid has a layered, concentric structure. It consists of a large outer border, an inner rectangle, and a patterned central horizontal band.\n- **Background**: The outermost layer of the grid is green, which can be considered the primary background or frame.\n\n### Objects and Shapes\nThe grid is composed of three distinct rectangular colored regions, nested within each other.\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame (Color 3)**: This is the largest shape, forming a border around the central content.\n2.  **Inner Red Rectangle (Color 2)**: A smaller rectangle is perfectly centered inside the green frame.\n3.  **Central Patterned Band**: This is a single row of cells in the exact vertical center of the grid. It is not a solid color but consists of an alternating pattern of blue and green cells.\n\n### Locations\nThe locations of these shapes and their components are as follows:\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame (Color 3)**:\n    - The top row: A1 to M1.\n    - The bottom row: A5 to M5.\n    - The leftmost column (within the central rows): A2, A3, A4.\n    - The rightmost column (within the central rows): M2, M3, M4.\n    - This creates a continuous one-cell-thick frame around the inner red rectangle.\n\n2.  **Inner Red Rectangle (Color 2)**:\n    - This shape occupies a 3x11 area from B2 to L4.\n    - Specifically, it comprises all cells in the top row of this area (B2 to L2) and the bottom row of this area (B4 to L4). The middle row (row 3) is occupied by the central patterned band.\n\n3.  **Central Patterned Band (Row 3)**:\n    - This band is located entirely within row 3, spanning from C3 to K3.\n    - **Blue Cells (Color 1)**: The blue cells are located at C3, E3, G3, I3, and K3.\n    - **Green Cells (Color 3)**: The green cells are located at D3, F3, H3, and J3.\n\n4.  **White Text Labels**:\n    - Every single cell in the grid, from A1 to M5, contains a white text label.\n    - Each label corresponds to the cell's own coordinate. For example, cell A1 contains the text \"A1\", cell G3 contains \"G3\", and cell M5 contains \"M5\".\n\n### Colors\n- **Green (3)**: Used for the outer frame and for alternating cells in the central band (D3, F3, H3, J3).\n- **Red (2)**: Used for the inner rectangle that frames the central band, specifically in rows 2 and 4 (from column B to L).\n- **Blue (1)**: Used for alternating cells in the central band (C3, E3, G3, I3, K3).\n- **White**: Used exclusively for the coordinate labels within each cell.\n\n### Relationships\n- **Spatial & Structural**:\n    - The structure is one of nested rectangles. The red rectangle is nested inside the green frame, with a one-cell gap on all sides.\n    - The central patterned band (in row 3) is nested within the red rectangle. The red cells of this rectangle are directly adjacent to the band, both above it (row 2) and below it (row 4).\n- **Color**:\n    - The green of the outer frame is the same color as the green cells within the central band.\n    - The colors in the central band (row 3, from C3 to K3) are strictly alternating between blue and green.\n\n### Patterns\n- **Concentric Framing**: The grid exhibits a clear pattern of concentric rectangular frames: an outer green frame, an inner red frame, and a central horizontal element.\n- **Alternating Color Sequence**: The most prominent pattern is in the central band (row 3). Starting from C3, the pattern is **Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue**.\n- **Column-based Color Pattern**: Within the central band (C3-K3), the blue cells (1) are all in odd-numbered columns (C=3, E=5, G=7, I=9, K=11), while the green cells (3) are in even-numbered columns (D=4, F=6, H=8, J=10).\n- **Coordinate System**: The white text labels form a perfect, regular grid pattern that explicitly defines the location of every cell.\n\n### Details\n- The puzzle is highly symmetrical along its horizontal axis (the centerline between rows 2 and 4, passing through row 3).\n- The text labels are a crucial element, providing a clear and unambiguous reference system for every component of the grid.\n- The boundaries between colors are sharp and align perfectly with the cell grid. There is no anti-aliasing or blending."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n### Color Mapping\n- 3 = green\n- 2 = red\n- 1 = blue\n- White (text, not in mapping)\n\n### 1. Objects and Shapes\nThe grid is composed of several nested rectangular shapes and text elements.\n\n*   **Outer Green Frame/Background:** A large green rectangle that forms the background and a one-cell-thick frame for the inner objects.\n*   **Inner Red Rectangle:** A large red rectangle is nested inside the green frame. It is 11 cells wide and 3 cells high.\n*   **Central Horizontal Band:** A horizontal band, 9 cells wide and 1 cell high, is cut out from the center of the red rectangle. This band is composed of smaller, single-cell squares of two different colors: blue and green.\n*   **Blue Squares:** There are four individual 1x1 blue squares located within the central horizontal band.\n*   **Green Squares:** There are five individual 1x1 green squares also located within the central horizontal band, interspersed with the blue squares.\n*   **Coordinate Labels:** Each cell in the entire grid contains a white text label indicating its spreadsheet-style coordinate (e.g., A1, B2, C3). The font is a simple, pixelated, block-style font.\n\n### 2. Locations\nThe grid coordinates are specified from A1 (top-left) to M5 (bottom-right).\n\n*   **Outer Green Frame/Background:** This occupies all cells in row 1 (A1 to M1), row 5 (A5 to M5), column A (A1 to A5), and column M (M1 to M5). It also includes the green squares within the central band.\n*   **Inner Red Rectangle:** This object spans from B2 to L4. Specifically, it fills all cells in the rectangular area defined by the corners B2, L2, B4, and L4, *except* for the central band in row 3.\n    *   The top part of the red rectangle is from B2 to L2.\n    *   The bottom part is from B4 to L4.\n    *   The vertical side-bars of the red rectangle are at B3 and L3.\n*   **Central Horizontal Band:** This band is located entirely within row 3, spanning from column C to column K (C3 to K3).\n    *   **Blue Squares** are located at cells: **C3, E3, G3, K3**.\n    *   **Green Squares** are located at cells: **D3, F3, H3, I3, J3**.\n*   **Coordinate Labels:** A unique label is centered within each of the 65 cells of the grid, from A1 to M5.\n\n### 3. Colors\nThree primary colors are used for the shapes, plus white for the text.\n\n*   **Green (3):** This color is used for the outermost frame/background (rows 1 & 5, columns A & M) and for the five squares within the central band at D3, F3, H3, I3, and J3.\n*   **Red (2):** This color fills the large inner rectangle from B2 to L4, surrounding the central band.\n*   **Blue (1):** This color is used exclusively for the four 1x1 squares at C3, E3, G3, and K3.\n*   **White:** This color is used for all the coordinate labels (A1, A2, etc.) overlaid on the colored cells.\n\n### 4. Relationships\n*   **Spatial & Structural Relationships:**\n    *   **Nesting:** The structure is concentric. The red rectangle is nested within the green frame. The central horizontal band (composed of blue and green squares) is nested within the red rectangle.\n    *   **Adjacency:** The red rectangle is directly adjacent to the inner edge of the green frame on all four sides. The blue and green squares in the central band are all adjacent to each other, forming a continuous horizontal line.\n    *   **Separation/Distance:** The red rectangle is separated from the grid's edge by a 1-cell wide green border. Within the central band, the blue squares are separated by a varying number of green squares:\n        *   Between C3 (blue) and E3 (blue), there is 1 green square (D3).\n        *   Between E3 (blue) and G3 (blue), there is 1 green square (F3).\n        *   Between G3 (blue) and K3 (blue), there are 3 green squares (H3, I3, J3).\n\n*   **Color Relationships:**\n    *   The green of the squares in the central band (D3, F3, etc.) is the same shade as the green of the outer frame/background. This creates a \"cut-through\" or \"transparent\" effect, as if the red rectangle has a window in its center showing the background color.\n\n### 5. Patterns\n*   **Grid Pattern:** The most obvious pattern is the regular grid structure itself, with each cell clearly delineated and labeled with its coordinate.\n*   **Symmetry:** The overall arrangement of the colored rectangles is horizontally symmetric. The red rectangle is centered horizontally, and the central band is also centered horizontally within the red rectangle.\n*   **Repetition in the Central Band:** The central band (C3 to K3) displays a sequence of colors: **Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Green, Green, Blue**. The initial \"Blue, Green\" pattern repeats twice, but the spacing between the blue squares is not uniform (1, 1, 3 green cells).\n\n### 6. Grid Structure\n*   **Dimensions:** The grid is 13 cells wide (columns A through M) and 5 cells high (rows 1 through 5).\n*   **Composition:** The grid is fully filled with colored cells. There are no empty (black/0) cells.\n*   **Background:** The effective background color is green (3).\n*   **Boundaries:** The changes in color create clear, hard-edged boundaries between the different rectangular regions.\n\n### 7. Details\n*   **Labels:** The presence of white coordinate labels in every cell is a defining feature of the image. This explicitly provides a coordinate system for referencing any part of the grid.\n*   **Clarity:** The image is a clean, digital graphic with solid, unaliased colors and sharp lines, typical of a puzzle or a diagram."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n**Color Mapping:**\n- 0 = black\n- 1 = blue\n- 2 = red\n- 3 = green\n\n---\n\n### 1. Objects and Shapes\n\nThe grid contains a set of nested rectangular shapes forming a frame-like structure.\n\n*   **Outer Frame:** A solid, one-cell-thick rectangular frame made of green (3) pixels. It defines the outer boundary of the entire grid.\n*   **Inner Frame/Rectangle:** A hollow rectangular frame made of red (2) pixels is perfectly nested inside the green frame. This red frame is 3 cells high and 11 cells wide. Its interior is filled with a different pattern.\n*   **Central Alternating Pattern:** Located in the single empty row of the inner red frame, this is a horizontal sequence of alternating blue (1) and green (3) pixels. The sequence is `[blue, green]` repeated four times, followed by a final blue pixel.\n\n### 2. Locations\n\nThe grid is 5 rows by 13 columns. Using spreadsheet notation (A1 is top-left, M5 is bottom-right):\n\n*   **Green Outer Frame (3):**\n    *   Top Row: A1 to M1.\n    *   Bottom Row: A5 to M5.\n    *   Left Column: A1 to A5.\n    *   Right Column: M1 to M5.\n\n*   **Red Inner Frame (2):**\n    *   This frame occupies the rectangular area from B2 to L4.\n    *   Top Edge: A continuous horizontal line of red pixels from B2 to L2.\n    *   Bottom Edge: A continuous horizontal line of red pixels from B4 to L4.\n    *   Left Edge: Red pixels at B2, B3, and B4.\n    *   Right Edge: Red pixels at L2, L3, and L4.\n\n*   **Central Alternating Pattern (Row 3):**\n    *   This pattern is located in the central row, from C3 to K3.\n    *   **Blue Pixels (1):** C3, E3, G3, I3, K3.\n    *   **Green Pixels (3):** D3, F3, H3, J3.\n\n### 3. Colors\n\nThree colors are present in the grid:\n\n*   **Green (3):** This color is used for the entire outer frame (A1:M1, A5:M5, A1:A5, M1:M5) and for four pixels in the central alternating pattern (D3, F3, H3, J3).\n*   **Red (2):** This color forms the inner rectangular frame, encompassing all cells from B2 to L2, B4 to L4, and the specific cells B3 and L3 which act as the vertical sides of this inner frame.\n*   **Blue (1):** This color is used exclusively in the central alternating pattern, at locations C3, E3, G3, I3, and K3.\n\n### 4. Relationships\n\n*   **Spatial & Structural Relationships:**\n    *   **Nesting:** The structure is composed of nested frames. The green frame encloses the red frame, which in turn encloses the central blue and green pattern.\n    *   **Adjacency:** The green and red frames are directly adjacent with no empty space between them. For example, the red line at B2:L2 is directly below the green line at B1:L1.\n    *   **Alignment:** All shapes are perfectly aligned to the grid's horizontal and vertical axes. The two horizontal red lines (Row 2 and Row 4) are parallel and separated by a single row (Row 3).\n    *   **Connectivity:** The outer green frame is a single, continuous, closed shape. The inner red frame is also a single, continuous, closed shape.\n\n*   **Color Relationships:**\n    *   The green used for the outer frame is the same green used in the central pattern.\n    *   The colors in the central pattern (blue and green) are distinct from the red color of the frame that immediately surrounds them.\n\n### 5. Patterns\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The grid exhibits perfect bilateral symmetry along two axes:\n    *   **Horizontal Axis:** The grid is symmetrical across its horizontal midline. Row 1 is identical to Row 5, and Row 2 is identical to Row 4. Row 3 is the axis of symmetry.\n    *   **Vertical Axis:** The grid is symmetrical across its vertical midline (Column G). For any row, the cell colors are mirrored around this central column. For example, in Row 3, C3 (blue) mirrors K3 (blue), and D3 (green) mirrors J3 (green). The pixel at G3 is on the axis itself.\n\n*   **Repetition:**\n    *   The central pattern in Row 3 contains a clear repeating element. The two-pixel sequence of `blue, green` (1, 3) is repeated four times from C3 to J3, followed by a final blue pixel at K3.\n\n### 6. Grid Structure\n\n*   **Dimensions:** The grid is 5 rows high and 13 columns wide (5x13).\n*   **Filled Regions:** The entire grid is filled with colored pixels; there are no empty or background (0) cells.\n*   **Boundaries:** The grid is bounded by a solid 1-pixel thick green frame that occupies the outermost rows and columns.\n\n### 7. Details\n\n*   The overall visual impression is that of a container, a digital display element, or a stylized fence.\n*   The composition is highly geometric and ordered, relying on simple rectangular forms and a periodic one-dimensional pattern.\n*   The use of a frame-within-a-frame structure is the dominant architectural feature of the puzzle."

There are no empty (black/0) cells.\n\n### Objects and Shapes\nThe grid is composed of three distinct, nested, colored shapes:\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame**: A large, hollow rectangular frame made of green (3) cells.\n    -   It has outer dimensions of 13x5 cells, occupying the entire grid.\n    -   The frame has a uniform thickness of 1 cell on all four sides.\n    -   This frame encloses an 11x3 inner area.\n\n2.  **Inner Red Rectangle**: A large rectangle made primarily of red (2) cells, situated inside the green frame.\n    -   Its outer boundary spans from B2 to L4, making it an 11x3 rectangle.\n    -   This shape is not solid red. Its central horizontal line (Row 3) is interrupted by a pattern of other colors. The only red cells on Row 3 are at B3 and L3, which act as the vertical sides of this shape.\n\n3.  **Central Alternating Pattern**: A one-dimensional horizontal pattern of single pixels located in the exact center of the grid.\n    -   This pattern is composed of five blue (1) pixels and four green (3) pixels.\n    -   The blue pixels are single 1x1 squares.\n    -   The green pixels are also single 1x1 squares, which can be seen as small vertical bars.\n\n### Locations\nThe grid coordinates are specified using spreadsheet notation (A-M for columns, 1-5 for rows).\n\n-   **Green (3) Cells**:\n    -   **Top Frame Border**: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1.\n    -   **Bottom Frame Border**: A5, B5, C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, H5, I5, J5, K5, L5, M5.\n    -   **Left Frame Border**: A2, A3, A4.\n    -   **Right Frame Border**: M2, M3, M4.\n    -   **Central Pattern Pixels**: D3, F3, H3, J3.\n\n-   **Red (2) Cells**:\n    -   **Top Inner Border**: B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2, H2, I2, J2, K2, L2.\n    -   **Bottom Inner Border**: B4, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, H4, I4, J4, K4, L4.\n    -   **Central Row Flankers**: B3, L3.\n\n-   **Blue (1) Cells**:\n    -   **Central Pattern Pixels**: C3, E3, G3, I3, K3.\n\n### Colors\n-   **Green (3)**: This is the most prevalent color.

The green frame completely encloses the red rectangle. The red rectangle, in turn, encloses the central blue and green pattern. All shapes are adjacent and touch one another without overlapping.\n-   **Alignment**: All shapes and patterns are perfectly aligned to the grid's horizontal and vertical axes.\n-   **Color**: The central pattern on Row 3 is defined by a strict color alternation of blue and green, starting and ending with blue. This pattern is flanked on its immediate left and right by red cells (B3, L3) and then by the green frame (A3, M3).\n\n### Patterns\nThe grid is highly regular and exhibits multiple layers of patterns and symmetry.\n\n-   **Symmetry**: The entire grid is perfectly symmetrical along two axes:\n    -   **Horizontal Symmetry**: It is symmetrical across the central row (Row 3). Row 1 is identical to Row 5, and Row 2 is identical to Row 4.\n    -   **Vertical Symmetry**: It is symmetrical across the central column (Column G). Column A is identical to Column M, Column B to Column L, Column C to Column K, and so on.\n\n-   **Repetition**:\n    -   **Central Pattern (Row 3)**: From C3 to K3, there is a repeating pattern of alternating colors: Blue (1), Green (3), Blue (1), Green (3), etc. The sequence is `1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1`.\n    -   **Columnar Pattern**: The columns themselves exhibit a repeating pattern based on their position relative to the center.\n        -   Columns C, E, G, I, K are identical (`3, 2, 1, 2, 3`).\n        -   Columns D, F, H, J are identical (`3, 2, 3, 2, 3`).\n        -   This creates an A-B-A-B... pattern of column types across the central section.\n\n### Details\n-   The overall visual impression is that of a stylized fence, gate, or perhaps a simple digital readout or keyboard.\n-   The central row (Row 3) is the most complex and information-rich part of the grid, containing the primary alternating pattern.\n-   The structure is built from simple 1x1 pixels arranged in a highly ordered, geometric, and symmetrical fashion."

Objects and Shapes\nThe grid contains a series of nested rectangular shapes forming a clear, layered structure.\n\n*   **Outer Frame:** The most prominent object is a complete, solid rectangular frame that defines the grid's outer boundary. This frame is 1 cell thick.\n*   **Inner Frame:** Nested perfectly inside the outer frame is a second, smaller rectangular frame. This inner frame is also 1 cell thick.\n*   **Central Dotted Line:** At the very center of the grid, inside the inner frame, is a horizontal line of alternating colored cells. This creates the appearance of a dashed or dotted line.\n\n### 2. Locations\nThe grid coordinates are described using spreadsheet notation (A-M for columns, 1-5 for rows).\n\n*   **Outer Green Frame (3):**\n    *   Top edge: A1 to M1.\n    *   Bottom edge: A5 to M5.\n    *   Left edge: A1 to A5.\n    *   Right edge: M1 to M5.\n\n*   **Inner Red Frame (2):**\n    *   Top edge: B2 to L2.\n    *   Bottom edge: B4 to L4.\n    *   Left edge: The cell at C2.\n    *   Right edge: The cell at L2.\n    *   *Note: The vertical sides of this frame are interrupted by the central pattern in Row 3.*\n\n*   **Central Pattern (Row 3):**\n    *   This pattern occupies the entirety of Row 3 (C1 to M1).\n    *   **Blue Cells (1):** Located at C3, C5, C7, C9, and C11.\n    *   **Green Cells (3):** Interspersed between the blue cells at C4, C6, C8, and C10.\n    *   **Red Cells (2):** Flanking the central pattern at C2 and L2.\n    *   **Green Cells (3):** The row begins and ends with green cells at C1 and M1, which are part of the outer frame.\n\n### 3. Colors\nThe grid uses three distinct colors: green, red, and blue.\n\n*   **Green (3):** This is the most prevalent color. It forms the entire outer 1-cell thick border of the grid. It also appears in the central row, alternating with blue cells.\n*   **Red (2):** This color forms the inner rectangular frame, located between the outer green frame and the central pattern.\n*   **Blue (1):** This is the least common color, appearing only as five single, separated cells in the exact horizontal centerline of the grid (Row 3).\n\n### 4. Relationships\nThe elements in the grid have strong and clear relationships.\n\n*   **Spatial & Structural Relationships:**\n    *   **Nesting:** The entire structure is nested. The red frame is perfectly centered within the green frame. The central blue-and-green pattern is perfectly centered within the red frame.\n    *   **Adjacency:** The green and red frames are directly adjacent to each other. The central pattern in Row 3 is directly adjacent to the top and bottom segments of the red frame.\n    *   **Separation:** The five blue cells in the center are separated from each other by single green cells.\n\n*   **Size Relationships:**\n    *   The outer green frame is a 5x13 rectangle.\n    *   The inner red frame is a 3x11 rectangle.\n    *   The central pattern is a 1x9 line of alternating cells, flanked by two red cells.\n\n### 5. Patterns\nThe grid is highly regular and exhibits strong patterns.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The grid is perfectly symmetrical along both its horizontal and vertical axes.\n    *   **Horizontal Symmetry:** Row 1 is identical to Row 5. Row 2 is identical to Row 4. Row 3 is the axis of symmetry.\n    *   **Vertical Symmetry:** The grid can be reflected across the central column (Column G). Column A is identical to M, B to L, C to K, and so on.\n*   **Repetition:**\n    *   The core of the central pattern in Row 3 consists of the two-cell sequence `1, 3` (blue, green) repeated four times, followed by a final `1` (blue).\n    *   The top and bottom parts of the inner frame (Rows 2 and 4) consist of a repeating line of eleven red (2) cells.\n\n### 6. Grid Structure\n*   **Dimensions:** The grid is 5 rows high and 13 columns wide.\n*   **Composition:** Every cell in the grid is filled with a color value (1, 2, or 3). There are no empty (0) cells.\n*   **Boundaries:** The grid is defined by a thick, solid green border. The internal structure is also defined by clear rectangular boundaries.\n\n### 7. Details\n*   The overall visual effect is that of a stylized, glowing bar or a container with a blinking or segmented light inside.\n*   The structure is very clean and geometric, suggesting a man-made object or a digital display element.\n*   The use of primary colors (red, blue) with a secondary color (green) creates high contrast and visual clarity."

There are five blue cells and four green cells in this sequence.\n\n### Relationships\n\n-   **Spatial & Structural**:\n    -   **Nesting**: The primary relationship is nesting. The green frame encloses the red frame, which in turn encloses the central blue and green pattern.\n    -   **Adjacency & Separation**: The green and red frames are adjacent, separated by a 0-cell gap. The red frame is adjacent to the central pattern.\n    -   **Alignment**: All structures are perfectly centered within the grid. The red frame has a uniform 1-cell green border on all four sides. The central pattern is centered horizontally within the red frame.\n\n-   **Color**:\n    -   The grid uses three distinct colors: green (3), red (2), and blue (1).\n    -   Green is used for both the outermost frame and as part of the innermost alternating pattern.\n    -   Red is used exclusively for the middle frame.\n    -   Blue is used exclusively for the innermost alternating pattern.\n\n### Patterns and Symmetries\n\n-   **Horizontal Symmetry**: The grid is perfectly symmetrical across its horizontal midline (Row C).\n    -   Row A is identical to Row E.\n    -   Row B is identical to Row D.\n    -   Row C is the axis of this symmetry.\n-   **Vertical Symmetry**: The grid is also perfectly symmetrical across its vertical midline (Column 7).\n    -   Column 1 is identical to Column 13.\n    -   Column 2 is identical to Column 12.\n    -   ...and so on, with Column 7 being the axis of symmetry.\n-   **Repetition**: The most prominent repeating pattern is the alternating `blue, green, blue, green...` sequence in the central row (C3-C11).\n\n### Details\n\n-   The overall visual effect is that of a container, frame, or perhaps a stylized representation of a battery or a digital display element.\n-   The structure is highly regular, geometric, and orderly.\n-   The use of green for both the outer boundary and the inner pattern creates a visual link between the two most separated parts of the grid."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe grid uses the following colors, which can be mapped to the specified numeric values:\n- **Green (3)**: Used for the background/border areas.\n- **Red (2)**: Used for two solid horizontal stripes and as separators in the middle stripe.\n- **Blue (1)**: Used for three rectangular blocks in the central horizontal stripe.\n- **White**: Not in the numeric mapping. Used for letters and symbols overlaid on the grid.\n- **Light Green/Teal**: Not in the numeric mapping. Used as the fill color for the small square symbols.\n\n### Grid Structure\n- **Dimensions**: The grid is 5 cells high and 13 cells wide (5 rows \u00d7 13 columns). I will refer to cells using a coordinate system where columns are A-M and rows are 1-5 (from top to bottom).\n- **Background**: The grid has a green (3) background that forms a one-cell-thick border on all four sides, with the exception of the central structure. Specifically, Row 1, Row 5, Column A, and Column M are entirely green.\n- **Filled vs. Empty Regions**: The central area of the grid, from B2 to L4, is filled with colored rectangular shapes (red and blue). The outer border (Row 1, Row 5, Column A, Column M) is the green background.\n\n### Objects and Shapes\n1.  **Central Colored Rectangle**: A large rectangular structure occupies the center of the grid. It is 3 cells high and 11 cells wide, spanning from B2 to L4. This structure is composed of three distinct horizontal stripes.\n2.  **Red Stripes**: There are two identical, solid red (2) horizontal stripes.\n    - The top red stripe is 1 cell high and 11 cells wide.\n    - The bottom red stripe is 1 cell high and 11 cells wide.\n3.  **Blue and Red Middle Stripe**: The central horizontal stripe is a composite of blue (1) blocks and red (2) separator cells.\n    - There are three rectangular blue blocks. The first two are 1x3 cells, and the third is 1x2 cells.\n    - There are three single red cells that act as separators between the blue blocks and at the beginning of the stripe.\n4.  **\"Slashed Square\" Symbols**: A small, white symbol is consistently overlaid on many cells. It consists of a white square outline with a white diagonal line running from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. The interior of this square is filled with a light green/teal color.\n5.  **Letters**: White, capital letters are overlaid on every cell of the grid.\n\n### Locations\n- **Green Background**: Located at A1:M1, A5:M5, A2:A4, and M2:M4.\n- **Central Rectangle (B2:L4)**:\n    - **Top Red Stripe**: Occupies the cells from B2 to L2.\n    - **Bottom Red Stripe**: Occupies the cells from B4 to L4.\n    - **Middle Stripe (Row 3)**:\n        - **Red Separator Cells**: B3, F3, J3.\n        - **Blue Block 1**: C3, D3, E3.\n        - **Blue Block 2**: G3, H3, I3.\n        - **Blue Block 3**: K3, L3.\n- **\"Slashed Square\" Symbols**: These symbols are present in a 5x11 grid, overlaid on every cell from B1 to L5. They are absent from Column A and Column M.\n- **Letters**: A letter is present in every cell of the 5x13 grid. The letter in each cell corresponds to its column. For example:\n    - All cells in Column A contain the letter 'A' (A1-A5).\n    - All cells in Column B contain the letter 'B' (B1-B5).\n    - This pattern continues across the grid to Column M, where all cells contain the letter 'M' (M1-M5).\n\n### Relationships\n- **Spatial Relationships**:\n    - The central colored rectangle (B2:L4) is centered vertically within the 5-row grid.\n    - The top red stripe (Row 2) and bottom red stripe (Row 4) are parallel and separated by the middle stripe (Row 3).\n    - In Row 3, the blue blocks are separated by single red cells. There is a 3-cell gap (C, D, E) between the red cells at B3 and F3. There is another 3-cell gap (G, H, I) between F3 and J3.\n- **Structural Relationships**:\n    - The \"slashed square\" symbols and the letters are overlaid on top of the colored background cells. They do not alter the color of the cell they are in but exist as a separate layer.\n    - The letters are structurally tied to their column position, creating a perfect vertical alignment of identical letters.\n\n### Patterns\n- **Symmetry**: The grid exhibits strong horizontal symmetry across the central row (Row 3). The top red stripe (Row 2) is a mirror image of the bottom red stripe (Row 4). The green border in Row 1 is a mirror of the green border in Row 5. The middle row itself is not perfectly symmetric due to the last blue block being 2 cells wide instead of 3.\n- **Repetition**:\n    - The \"slashed square\" symbol is repeated in every cell from Column B to Column L.\n    - The pattern of letters is a simple repetition down each column (e.g., A,A,A,A,A).\n    - The pattern in the middle row is almost a repeating sequence of `1 Red, 3 Blue`, but this pattern breaks at the end. The sequence is: `Red(1), Blue(3), Red(1), Blue(3), Red(1), Blue(2)`.\n\n### Details\n- The \"slashed square\" symbol is a key visual element. Its specific design (white outline, top-right to bottom-left slash, light green fill) is consistent across all its appearances.\n- The letters are a simple, white, sans-serif font. Their presence in every cell and their direct correlation with the column index is a fundamental rule of the grid's construction.\n- The image includes coordinate labels (A-M on top, and five 'A's on the left) which are annotations to help with analysis, but the letters *inside* the grid cells are part of the puzzle's data itself."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a detailed visual analysis of the provided puzzle grid.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe image uses colors that can be mapped to the provided numeric values:\n- **Blue (1)**\n- **Red (2)**\n- **Green (3)**\n- **White** (Text overlay, not in the provided mapping)\n\n### 1. Objects and Shapes\nThe grid contains several distinct geometric objects and a text overlay:\n\n*   **Large Red Rectangle**: There is a single, large, solid red rectangle that forms the main central figure. It is 11 cells wide and 3 cells high.\n*   **Small Blue Rectangles**: There are five small, solid blue rectangles. Each is a single square cell (1x1 in size).\n*   **Green Background/Frame**: The area surrounding the central red rectangle is a solid green color, forming a background or a frame.\n*   **White Text Characters**: A full set of coordinate labels (e.g., A1, A2, B1, B2) is rendered in a white, pixelated font. These characters are overlaid on top of all colored cells.\n\n### 2. Locations\nThe grid is organized into a 5x13 coordinate system (A-M for columns, 1-5 for rows).\n\n*   **Large Red Rectangle**: This rectangle occupies the area from cell B2 to L4. Its boundaries are:\n    *   Top edge: Row 2, from B2 to L2.\n    *   Bottom edge: Row 4, from B4 to L4.\n    *   Left edge: Column B, from B2 to B4.\n    *   Right edge: Column L, from L2 to L4.\n*   **Small Blue Rectangles**: These five 1x1 rectangles are located exclusively along the central row (Row 3) and are positioned inside the larger red rectangle. Their specific coordinates are:\n    *   **C3**\n    *   **E3**\n    *   **G3**\n    *   **I3**\n    *   **K3**\n*   **Green Background/Frame**: The green color fills all cells not occupied by the red rectangle. This includes:\n    *   The entire top row (Row 1, from A1 to M1).\n    *   The entire bottom row (Row 5, from A5 to M5).\n    *   The entire leftmost column (Column A, from A1 to A5).\n    *   The entire rightmost column (Column M, from M1 to M5).\n*   **White Text Characters**: The text is overlaid directly on top of the grid. Each column has its coordinates written vertically from top to bottom. For example:\n    *   In Column A, the text \"A1 A2 A3 A4 A5\" is written downwards.\n    *   In Column G, the text \"G1 G2 G3 G4 G5\" is written downwards, with \"G3\" appearing on top of the central blue cell.\n\n### 3. Colors\n*   **Green (3)**: This color serves as the background and forms a one-cell-thick frame around the central structure. It is located in rows 1 and 5, and columns A and M.\n*   **Red (2)**: This is the dominant color of the central object, the 3x11 rectangle spanning B2:L4.\n*   **Blue (1)**: This color is used for the five individual cells (C3, E3, G3, I3, K3) embedded within the red rectangle.\n*   **White**: This color is used exclusively for the coordinate text overlay.\n\n### 4. Relationships\n*   **Spatial Relationships**:\n    *   **Nesting**: The five blue cells are nested within the large red rectangle. The red rectangle is, in turn, nested within the green frame/background.\n    *   **Adjacency**: The red rectangle is directly adjacent to the green frame on all four sides. Each blue cell is completely surrounded by red cells.\n    *   **Spacing**: The blue cells are evenly spaced. They are located in every other column along Row 3, with exactly one red cell separating each blue cell (e.g., cell D3 is red and lies between blue cells C3 and E3).\n*   **Size Relationships**:\n    *   The green background is the largest area.\n    *   The red rectangle is the largest discrete shape.\n    *   The blue rectangles are the smallest shapes (1x1 cell each).\n*   **Structural Relationships**:\n    *   The structure is concentric, with the blue cells at the very center, surrounded by red, which is surrounded by green.\n\n### 5. Patterns\n*   **Repetition**: The most prominent pattern is the horizontal repetition of the blue cells along Row 3. The pattern is `Blue-Red-Blue-Red-Blue-Red-Blue-Red-Blue` across columns C through K.\n*   **Symmetry**: The arrangement of colored shapes is perfectly symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.\n    *   **Horizontal Axis of Symmetry**: Row 3. The red cells in Row 2 are a mirror image of the red cells in Row 4.\n    *   **Vertical Axis of Symmetry**: Column G. The arrangement of shapes in columns A-F is a mirror image of the arrangement in columns H-M. The central blue cell is located on this axis at G3.\n*   **Coordinate Text Pattern**: The text overlay follows a strict, repeating pattern where each column `X` contains the vertical text sequence `X1, X2, X3, X4, X5`.\n\n### 6. Grid Structure\n*   **Dimensions**: The grid is 5 cells high and 13 cells wide.\n*   **Filled Regions**: The entire grid is filled with color. There are no empty (black) cells.\n*   **Background Color**: The background/frame color is Green (3).\n*   **Boundaries**: The grid is bounded by a one-cell-thick green frame on all four sides (Row 1, Row 5, Column A, Column M).\n\n### 7. Details\n*   **Text Overlay**: The most unusual feature is the explicit, white text coordinate system overlaid directly onto the image, labeling every single cell. This is not typical of simple grid puzzles and is a key characteristic.\n*   **Font**: The font used for the text is a stylized, pixelated, monospaced font.\n*   **Texture**: The image has a slightly grainy or noisy texture, but this does not obscure the primary shapes or colors."

The entire pattern spans 9 cells horizontally.\n\n- **Object 4: Text Labels**\n    - **Shape**: White text characters (letters and numbers) are present in every cell of the 5x13 grid.\n    - **Content**: Each cell contains its own coordinate label (e.g., the cell at the top-left corner contains \"A1\"). The letter is always positioned above the number within the cell.\n    - **Font**: The font is a simple, monospaced, blocky/pixelated style.\n\n### **3. Locations**\n- **Outer Green Frame (3)**:\n    - Top row: A1 to M1.\n    - Bottom row: A5 to M5.\n    - Left column: A2, A3, A4.\n    - Right column: M2, M3, M4.\n\n- **Central Red Rectangle (2)**:\n    - This object spans from column B to column L and from row 2 to row 4.\n    - Its top-left corner is at B2 and its bottom-right corner is at L4.\n\n- **Inner Segmented Bar**:\n    - This pattern is located entirely within **Row 3**.\n    - The **blue (1)** segments are located at cells: **C3, E3, G3, I3, K3**.\n    - The gaps between the blue segments reveal the background **green (3)** color. These green gaps are located at cells: **D3, F3, H3, J3**.\n\n- **Text Labels (White)**:\n    - A text label exists in every cell from A1 to M5. For example, text \"G3\" is in cell G3, text \"L4\" is in cell L4, etc.\n\n### **4. Relationships**\n- **Spatial & Structural**:\n    - The structure is one of nested rectangles. The red rectangle is perfectly centered within the green frame. The inner segmented bar is perfectly centered (vertically and horizontally) within the red rectangle.\n    - There is a 1-cell wide green border between the edge of the grid and the red rectangle.\n    - There is a 1-cell wide red border between the edge of the red rectangle and the inner segmented bar.\n    - The text labels are overlaid on top of all colored regions.\n\n- **Color**:\n    - The colors define the boundaries of the nested shapes.\n    - The white text provides high contrast against all three background colors (green, red, and blue).\n    - The inner bar in Row 3 consists of an alternating sequence of blue and green cells.\n\n### **5. Patterns**\n- **Concentricity**: The primary pattern is the nesting of the red rectangle within the green frame.\n- **Symmetry**: The overall image (ignoring the text content) is perfectly symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.\n    - The vertical axis of symmetry is column G.\n    - The horizontal axis of symmetry is row 3.\n- **Alternating Sequence**: The most prominent pattern is in Row 3, from C3 to K3. It is a regular, alternating pattern of colors:\n    - **Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue**\n    - This can be described as a (Blue, Green) pair repeated four times, followed by a final Blue cell.\n\n### **6. Details**\n- **Text Orientation**: Within each cell, the coordinate text is displayed vertically, with the column letter appearing above the row number.\n- **Clarity**: The image is a clear, non-ambiguous representation of a grid.

      "description": "Of course. Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe grid displays colors directly. Based on the standard color mapping provided:\n- **Green** would correspond to the number **3**.\n- **Red** would correspond to the number **2**.\n- **Blue** would correspond to the number **1**.\n- **Teal** (a shade of cyan/green-blue) would correspond to the number **8**.\n- The text is **White**. The background/empty color **Black (0)** is not present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Description\n\n#### 1. Grid Structure\n*   **Dimensions**: The grid is a rectangular grid of 13 columns and 5 rows. The columns are labeled 'A' through 'M' and the rows are labeled '1' through '5'.\n*   **Overall Layout**: The grid is fully populated with colored cells. The structure is composed of nested, concentric rectangular shapes.\n*   **Text Overlay**: Every cell in the grid contains a white text label that corresponds to its own coordinate in spreadsheet notation (e.g., the cell at the top-left corner is labeled \"A1\").\n\n#### 2. Objects and Shapes\nThe grid contains three primary colored objects arranged in a nested fashion:\n\n1.  **An Outer Green Frame**: A hollow rectangle forming the border of the entire grid.\n2.  **A Middle Red Frame**: A smaller hollow rectangle nested inside the green one.\n3.  **An Inner Segmented Bar**: A horizontal bar made of alternating blue and teal squares, located in the very center of the grid.\n\n#### 3. Locations\n*   **Outer Green Frame**: This object occupies the entire perimeter of the 13x5 grid. It is 1 cell thick.\n    *   **Top edge**: Cells A1 through M1.\n    *   **Bottom edge**: Cells A5 through M5.\n    *   **Left edge**: Cells A1 through A5.\n    *   **Right edge**: Cells M1 through M5.\n\n*   **Middle Red Frame**: This object is nested within the green frame, leaving a 1-cell green border around it. It is also 1 cell thick.\n    *   **Location**: It occupies the perimeter of the rectangular area from B2 to L4.\n    *   **Top edge**: Cells B2 through L2.\n    *   **Bottom edge**: Cells B4 through L4.\n    *   **Left edge**: Cells B2, B3, B4.\n    *   **Right edge**: Cells L2, L3, L4.\n\n*   **Inner Segmented Bar**: This object is a single horizontal row of cells located in the absolute center of the grid, inside the red frame.\n    *   **Location**: It occupies row 3, from column C to column K (cells C3 through K3).\n    *   **Segmentation**: The bar is not a solid color. It is composed of alternating 1x1 colored squares.\n        *   **Blue Squares**: Located at C3, E3, G3, I3, and K3.\n        *   **Teal Squares**: Located at D3, F3, H3, and J3.\n\n#### 4. Colors\n*   **Green (3)**: Used for the outermost 1-cell thick frame (A1:M1, A5:M5, A2:A4, M2:M4).\n*   **Red (2)**: Used for the middle 1-cell thick frame, which encloses the central row (B2:L2, B4:L4, B3, L3).\n*   **Blue (1)**: Used for five individual cells in the central bar at C3, E3, G3, I3, and K3.\n*   **Teal (8)**: Used for four individual cells in the central bar at D3, F3, H3, and J3.\n*   **White**: Used for all the coordinate text labels (e.g., \"A1\", \"B2\", etc.) present in every cell.\n\n#### 5. Relationships\n*   **Spatial & Structural**:\n    *   **Nesting**: The core structure is one of nesting. The Green Frame contains the Red Frame, which in turn contains the central Blue/Teal Bar.\n    *   **Adjacency**: The red frame is immediately adjacent to the inner boundary of the green frame. The central bar (C3:K3) is immediately adjacent to the red cells above it (in row 2) and below it (in row 4).\n    *   **Separation**: There is a 1-cell wide green border separating the red frame from the edge of the grid. There is a 1-cell wide red border separating the central bar from the green frame.\n*   **Color Relationships**:\n    *   The central bar features a strict alternating color pattern of blue and teal.\n    *   The frames are monochromatic (solid green and solid red).\n\n#### 6. Patterns\n*   **Concentric Rectangles**: The grid displays a clear pattern of two concentric, hollow rectangles.\n*   **Alternating Colors**: The innermost bar in row 3 has a perfectly regular, alternating pattern of colors: Blue, Teal, Blue, Teal, Blue, Teal, Blue, Teal, Blue. The pattern begins and ends with Blue.\n*   **Coordinate System**: There is a systematic pattern where every cell is explicitly labeled with its own grid coordinate. This overlay provides a perfect reference map of the grid itself.\n*   **Symmetry**: The overall arrangement of the colored frames is perfectly symmetrical both horizontally (across the middle of row 3) and vertically (across the middle of column G). The inner bar itself is also horizontally symmetrical around its center cell, G3.\n\n#### 7. Details\n*   **Font**: The white text labels appear to be a simple, monospaced, pixel-art style font. The letter is always positioned directly above the number within the cell.\n*   **Aesthetic**: The image has a clean, digital, and pixelated appearance, reminiscent of retro computer graphics or a puzzle interface. The colors are flat, solid, and highly saturated."

      "description": "Of course. Here is a very detailed visual analysis of the puzzle grid provided.\n\n### Color Mapping\nThe colors in the grid correspond to the following numeric values:\n-   **Green**: 3\n-   **Red**: 2\n-   **Blue**: 1\n-   **White**: Used for text labels, not part of the 0-9 mapping.\n-   **Black (0)**: Not present in the image.\n\n### 1. Grid Structure\n-   **Dimensions**: The grid is a 13x5 matrix, with 13 columns labeled 'A' through 'M' and 5 rows labeled '1' through '5'.\n-   **Background Color**: The fundamental background of the entire grid is **Green (3)**. This green forms a one-cell-wide border around a central rectangular shape. The cells in this border are: A1-M1, A2-A5, M2-M5, and A5-M5.\n-   **Grid Labels**: Every cell in the grid is explicitly labeled with its coordinate in **White** text. The labels follow a standard spreadsheet format (e.g., A1, B2, C3). The letter (column) is positioned directly above the number (row) within each cell.\n\n### 2. Objects and Shapes\nThere are three primary colored, rectangular objects arranged in a nested structure.\n\n1.  **Outer Green Frame/Background**: This is the base layer of the grid, occupying all 65 cells (A1 to M5). It is most visible as a 1-cell thick frame around the inner red rectangle.\n2.  **Central Red Rectangle**: A large, solid **Red (2)** rectangle is positioned in the center of the grid.\n    -   **Boundaries**: It spans from cell B2 to L4.\n    -   **Size**: It is 11 cells wide and 3 cells high (11x3).\n3.  **Inner Horizontal Bar**: Located in the middle row of the red rectangle, this is a horizontal bar composed of smaller, alternating colored squares.\n    -   **Boundaries**: It spans from cell C3 to K3.\n    -   **Size**: It is 9 cells wide and 1 cell high (9x1).\n    -   **Composition**: The bar is not a solid color but is made of nine 1x1 squares. It consists of five **Blue (1)** squares and four **Green (3)** squares.\n\n### 3. Locations\n-   **Green (3) Background/Frame**:\n    -   Top row: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1.\n    -   Bottom row: A5, B5, C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, H5, I5, J5, K5, L5, M5.\n    -   Left column (excluding corners): A2, A3, A4.\n    -   Right column (excluding corners): M2, M3, M4.\n-   **Red (2) Rectangle**:\n    -   Occupies the rectangular area defined by the corners B2, L2, B4, and L4.\n    -   This includes all cells from column B to L in rows 2 and 4, and cells B3 and L3 in row 3.\n-   **Inner Horizontal Bar (Row 3)**:\n    -   **Blue (1) Squares**: Located at C3, E3, G3, I3, K3.\n    -   **Green (3) Squares**: Located at D3, F3, H3, J3.\n\n### 4. Relationships\n-   **Spatial & Structural (Nesting)**: The objects are nested concentrically. The Green background encloses the Red rectangle, which in turn encloses the inner Blue and Green bar.\n    -   The Red rectangle is perfectly centered on the grid, with a 1-cell wide Green border on all four sides.\n    -   The inner bar (C3-K3) is perfectly centered within the Red rectangle. It has a 1-cell Red border to its left (B3) and right (L3), and a 1-cell Red border above it (row B2-L2) and below it (row B4-L4).\n-   **Color Relationships**:\n    -   The Green squares within the inner bar (D3, F3, H3, J3) are the exact same color as the outer Green background/frame. This creates a visual effect of \"cut-outs\" or \"windows\" in the Red rectangle, revealing the background color.\n    -   The colors in the inner bar (C3-K3) alternate strictly between Blue and Green.\n\n### 5. Patterns\n-   **Symmetry**: The entire composition is perfectly symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.\n    -   The vertical axis of symmetry runs down the middle of column G.\n    -   The horizontal axis of symmetry runs through the middle of row 3.\n-   **Alternating Pattern**: The most prominent pattern is the color alternation in the inner bar on row 3. Starting from C3, the pattern is: **Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue, Green, Blue**.\n-   **Repetition**: The coordinate labeling system is a repeating pattern across the entire grid.\n\n### 6. Details\n-   **Font**: The white text for the coordinates is rendered in a simple, pixelated, sans-serif font.\n-   **Visual Illusion**: The use of the background green color for some squares inside the red rectangle (D3, F3, H3, J3) is a key feature. It connects the innermost part of the image directly with the outermost frame, suggesting a layered structure where the red layer has been perforated."
